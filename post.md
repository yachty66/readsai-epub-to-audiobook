Hey Python developers!

I created a super minimal template that makes it really easy to publish Python
packages to PyPl. Whenever I come back to publishing a Python package to PyPl, I find myself spending too much time thinking about how to do it. I found existing templates that are popular but too extensive; that's why I created a really simple one with step-by-step instructions. What it does:




Title: A Minimal Python Package Template for Easy PyPI Publishing [Showcase]

**What My Project Does:**
This is a minimal template repository that streamlines the process of publishing Python packages to PyPI. It provides the absolute bare minimum structure and step-by-step instructions to get your package published quickly. Includes a working "Hello World" example to demonstrate the workflow and a GitHub SEO optimization trick.

**Target Audience:**
- Beginner Python developers who want to publish their first package
- Developers who want a quick starting point for new PyPI packages
- Educational purposes / learning how Python packaging works

**Comparison with Alternatives:**
Unlike other package templates (like cookiecutter-pypackage or poetry new), this template:
- Has minimal dependencies (just setuptools and twine)
- Uses only a few core files instead of dozens
- Includes clear, numbered steps in the README
- Focuses on getting to PyPI quickly rather than adding features
- Adds guidance for GitHub SEO optimization
