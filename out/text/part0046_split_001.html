			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Even though it is only February, the sun is beating down mercilessly on the roof of the Intel building in Chandler, Arizona. It is 2023, and this tall building on Old Price Road is the perfect place to watch the reconstruction of the American chip industry up close. Surrounded by a forest of cranes, workers assemble the steel frames for two enormous chip factories. The area once smelled of vast onion fields; now, the dust clouds from trucks and bulldozers mixed with the water vapor rising from the air treatment plants is giving off a new scent: progress.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2025, Fab 52 and Fab 62 will start churning out millions of processors. A staggering four floors high and four soccer fields wide, the production lines in these fabs will run Veldhoven’s <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines and connect to the same distribution center that already supplies the existing cleanrooms with a continuous flow of gases and chemicals.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This is Ocotillo Campus, erected in Chandler by Intel in the early eighties. It became the main production site for the American chip giant and the breeding ground for a vibrant semiconductor industry – that is why <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> chose Arizona as the location of its first<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> operation.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Rainwater is scarce in the desert, which is why Intel recycles all cooling water from its factories. Still, in Chandler, subsidies are raining down by the billions. Intel’s new chip factories are eligible for the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> chips act, a support package totaling 52 billion dollars of which 39 billion is earmarked to stimulate chip manufacturing on American soil. Tens of thousands of jobs have been created, both to build the factories and to keep them running. The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> is dependent on Asian factories for high-end chips, and has fallen from producing almost 40 percent of the world’s chips in the early nineties to less than 12 percent by 2023. With the Chips Act in his arsenal, Joe Biden vows to turn the tide.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To qualify for government aid, companies had to agree not to build advanced chip factories in China or other ‘countries of concern’. Nor were they allowed to expand their existing capacity in those countries. The Chips Act was effective on all fronts: more chips in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, less in China.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Intel saw an opportunity and seized it with both hands. The chipmaker invested 20 billion dollars for the expansion in Arizona and claimed 8 billion in subsidies, while also relying on state support for its new factories in Ohio. The Chips Act was the spur the American chip giant needed; now, it had a chance to catch up with the Asian competition.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In February of 2021, Intel welcomed Pat Gelsinger as its new <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>. His appointment was intended to spell the end of a turbulent period, marked by a revolving door of <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>s and delayed products. Immediately after taking office, he reached out to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. The stars had aligned: he urgently needed <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines for the American expansion and wanted to capitalize on European subsidies for establishing their own semiconductor industry.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Meanwhile, politicians in the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> had recognized the strategic importance of having a resilient chip industry in their own regions. The <span class="fft-kk">COVID</span>-19 pandemic had forced Europe to face some hard facts about the vulnerability of global production chains in times of crisis. European countries had panicked when confronted with sudden shortages of face masks and other medical supplies. In addition, a chip shortage had shocked the car industry, and everyone immediately understood the fragility of the supply line for semiconductors.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As of 2023, the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> accounted for just eight percent of global chip production. Complete self-sufficiency was never in the cards, but the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> Commissioner for Digital Affairs Thierry Breton hoped that by 2030, 20 percent of the world’s chips would come from Europe. He certainly did not lack ambition.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To get Intel’s European expansion plans off on the right foot, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> gave Pat Gelsinger a helping hand with the initial discussions. When the Intel <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> visited The Hague in June of 2021 for a meeting with Mark Rutte, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> provided the agenda for the prime minister. Given Rutte’s technological ineptitude, this was not an unnecessary act. He still preferred to send text messages from his ancient Nokia, and to quickly delete them after that. To free up memory, so Rutte’s explanation went.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">After the meeting, Gelsinger travelled directly to Brussels to meet with European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and to visit imec, the Leuven-based research institute and close collaborator of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. The lines of communication between Brussels and Brabant were short. For example, European Commissioner Breton called Peter Wennink after the summer of 2021 to ask whether <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would set up a link with <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and Samsung. He wanted to approach the Asian chip manufacturers for expansion in Europe, but they seemed considerably less eager than Intel had been.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In November, Breton, along with Vestager and the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, paid a visit to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> for a talk behind closed doors. They were joined by Peter Wennink, Mark Rutte and the Director General of Economic Affairs Focco Vijselaar for a tour of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s showroom, ‘the experience center’. One day later, Von der Leyen issued a statement: ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> will play a significant role in making the European tech sector more competitive and independent.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And she did not waste any time. Immediately after the visit, a request came in from Brussels. They wanted <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to provide a position paper, a vision for the future of the European chip sector and the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span>’s Chips Act. This document needed to be done by the beginning of 2022, before the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> continued discussions in the <span class="fft-kk">TTC</span>, the Transatlantic Trade and Technology Council.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> set to work collaborating with chip companies to develop a long-term plan. It anticipated the demand for chips would double in the coming ten years, given the chips needed for data centers and the ‘explosion’ of artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and smart electricity networks. And if Europe wanted chip factories to produce the fastest processors on its own territory, it would need help from the major Asian or American chip giants. European chip manufacturers were too far behind to catch up in that race. Additionally, industries like the automotive sector <a id="_idTextAnchor048" class="calibre3"></a>were in need of more common chips, and European chip companies like <span class="fft-kk">NXP</span>, Infineon, or STMicroelectronics also needed to expand.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As the key player in the industry, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> seemed to be the one directing the formation of the European Chips Act. Peter Wennink found this a little over the top. He saw his company more as an ‘influencer’. In the end, politicians have the final say, and economic logic is never the only thing they take into account.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But in this case, the playbooks of Brussels and Veldhoven were neatly synchronized. On February 8, 2022, the same day <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> published its position paper for the European chip industry, the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> announced a stimulus plan worth 43 billion euros.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As expected, Intel followed with an announcement one month later. The chipmaker would be investing 33 billion euros into European expansion projects, including 17 billion for a large factory near the German city of Magdeburg. This location ticked all the boxes: it was close to the German automotive industry, with a university around the corner and, unlike Arizona, there was not a cow in sight.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Intel continued to distribute its budget over Italy, Ireland, France, Poland and the Netherlands. In return, it expected substantial subsidies. 6.8 billion euros was requested for Magdeburg alone, accounting for 40 percent of the expected start-up costs. Meanwhile, France invested 2.9 billion euros in a chip factory operated by GlobalFoundries and the French company STMicroelectronics.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> Chips Act signaled a U-turn in European policy. Traditionally, state aid had been prohibited to prevent competition between member states, and countries were only allowed to use public funds to assist companies under strict conditions. The new law ran directly against these historic principles, but in light of the tensions between China and the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> recognized its industrial policy needed to change if it were to become more resilient and independent.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Europe had already faced a painful punishment through its dependence on foreign powers. When the war in Ukraine broke out, it suddenly had to extricate itself from Russian oil and gas supplies, causing an unprecedented energy crisis. The bloc was desperate to avoid a similar situation around semiconductors. The chip shortage had been a wakeup call, and the nightmare scenario was front and center on everyone’s mind: ‘If China blocks Taiwan, we’ll be without chips within two weeks,’ Thierry Breton declared in September of 2022 during the opening of the academic year at Eindhoven University of Technology.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><a id="_idTextAnchor049" class="calibre3"></a>In reality, the 43 billion euros that made up the European stimulus package was a mixed bag of recovery funds, adjusted innovation programs and above all, large sums of money from the member states themselves. By the start of 2023, the proposal had made its way through the machinery of Brussels, only to coincide with a downturn in the chip industry. The sector might grow over the long term, but these peaks and valleys are dependable and unavoidable, just like the ebb and flow of the tide.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The dip caused Intel to slow its expansions in Germany. With the investment costs for the factory escalating from 17 to 30 billion euros, the chip giant surprised the Germans by upping its demand for state aid from 6.8 to 10 billion euros. Intel wanted to build more production lines in Magdeburg in response to the increase in <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s investment in its Arizona factory to 40 billion dollars. It was a tough pill to swallow, but the Germans agreed.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Pat Gelsinger was the shining star at the center of this downpour of subsidies, also in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. He was present at the 2022 State of the Union address as Joe Biden attempted to push his Chips Act through Congress. This process took longer than expected: both parties agreed the American chip industry needed support, but their toxic disagreements on other issues destroyed any ability to make practical decisions.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This frustrated the Intel <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> to no end, and in June of 2022 he decided to halt construction on the Ohio project. His message: show<span class="fft-kk"> </span>us the stimulus money, then the bulldozers will keep digging. When the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Chips and Science Act was finally signed in the ceremonial garden of the White House in August, Gelsinger was <a id="_idTextAnchor050" class="calibre3"></a>smiling: threatening to hit the pause button had worked.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The factories Intel was building in the plains of Ohio – the ‘fields of dreams’ as Joe Biden called them – cost around 20 billion dollars, just like Fab 52 and Fab 62. They were exact replicas of the new construction in Chandler, down to the entrance and interior design. Even the restrooms were in the same place. Why spend money and time changing a design you know works?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Intel also applied this ‘copy exactly’ principle to its production lines. Every detail of the manufacturing process was meticulously examined to iron out any errors, and then replicated exactly in other factories. Chip specialists delved into research and re-research, before translating the methodology into elaborate procedures. Intel took it slow in this process. <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines had already been running tests for years in the cleanrooms of the development department in Hillsboro, Oregon. The company wanted to first eliminate all risks before taking one giant leap ahead of the competition. But such a leap is big, even for a giant chip company. After all, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and Samsung had already begun high-volume <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> production five years earlier. The Asian competitors were less risk-<a id="_idTextAnchor051" class="calibre3"></a>averse, and had already set up production lines when the chip machines were still effectively held together by a threadbare wire. Scoring wafers and solving problems on the fly – that’s what it was all about. Those who make mistakes fast innovate fast.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But Intel had a different approach. As an integrated device manufacturer, it designed and manufactured its own chips. Intel’s so-called x86 architecture had long been dominant across the world, with these chips found in almost every Windows PC or server on the market since the 1980s. If you bought a new computer before 2006, chances are you would have peeled an ‘Intel Inside’ sticker off the front of it. The updated slogan ‘Leap Ahead’ didn’t stick quite as well.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For decades, Intel dominated the chip industry with its solid sales market for PCs. But then the challenge from the East appeared, bringing with it a flexible foundry model and military-grade discipline. These Asian competitors responded better to the smartphone revolution, which had a much shorter innovation cycle than the PC market Intel had dictated. Intel’s processors were also no match for the energy-efficient <span class="fft-kk">ARM</span> chip designs that became the basis for the entire mobile industry.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">By going fabless, chip designers such as Qualcomm, <span class="fft-kk">AMD</span> and Nvidia had earlier access to more advanced technology through the Asian factories they used. To reflect the demand for wafers, they could adjust their orders with <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> every quarter. Intel finally jumped on this ‘fabless’ trend, and upon assuming office Pat Gelsinger initiated a new business division, called Intel Foundry Services, to manufacture chips for other companies. It was no pure-play foundry like <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, but it was a necessity: without orders from others, the Americans would not have a large enough scale of operations to recoup their investments in the latest technology. For a company struggling with change, this was a radical cultural shift.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Gelsinger was betting the future of his company, but he had an ace up his sleeve. Intel was the only remaining transatlantic chip manufacturer with a chance to keep up with the Asian competition. Without Intel, shifting the power balance of the chip industry would be an impossible task. The epicenter would undoubtedly remain in Asia, since Samsung and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> preferred to keep the production of their most advanced chips in their own country.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Asian chip companies were also benefiting from the shower of subsidies. Samsung began construction on a factory in Texas for 17 billion <a id="_idTextAnchor052" class="calibre3"></a>dollars, and considered <a id="_idTextAnchor053" class="calibre3"></a>opening up a factory in Europe. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> also expanded in Japan – another country that opened the subsidy floodgates with its ‘Rapidus’ project. Additionally, the Taiwanese also planned to build a factory in the German city of Dresden, along with European chip manufacturers Bosch, <span class="fft-kk">NXP</span> and Infineon. This factory would receive five billion euros in subsidies.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">These projects were modest in comparison to South Korea and Taiwan’s plans for expansion on home turf. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> remained cautious about producing the most advanced chip technology in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, as this could weaken the island’s silicon shield by making the chip factories in Taiwan less indispensable. However, a solution was put on the table. In exchange for increasing advanced chip production in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, Taiwan wanted additional guarantees of military support from the Americans. The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> obliged. In September 2022, one month after Nancy Pelosi’s controversial visit, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> approved a 1.1 billion–dollar weapons shipment to Taiwan. Three months later, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> increased its investment in Arizona from 12 to 40 billion dollars and included newer production technology. Chips for weapons, weapons for chips: that is the tech war in a nutshell.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Years before the first shovel ever hit the ground, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was <a id="_idTextAnchor054" class="calibre3"></a>well aware of <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s plans to build factories north of Phoenix, Arizona. The company needed time to train support staff: it takes two and a half years to learn how to maintain the complex <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> provided this training in the Taiwanese city of Tainan but decided to start a training center in Arizona capable of instructing 16,000 people per year. There was only one problem: you can build a school as big as you like, but can you get the students to fill it?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The lack of technical talent is the Achilles heel of the American chip strategy, with the level of education in the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> falling far short of that in Asia. For Joe Biden, the Chips Act provided an opportunity to elevate the American education system. He asked Congress to allocate tens of billions of dollars to help prepare children for the technical jobs of the future. The whole country <a id="_idTextAnchor055" class="calibre3"></a>was in need of an upgrade, not just the chip industry.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In December of 2022, Biden welcomed the first chip machines into the <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> factory in Arizona. To mark the occasion, a massive banner reading ‘MADE IN AMERICA’ was hung from the building, despite the factory belonging entirely to a Taiwanese company. The setting was quintessentially American: a desert plain dotted with cacti, with the Ben Avery Shooting Facility as the noisy neighbor. Everyone is welcome at this public shooting range: even a five-year-old child can shoot a pistol here – provided the firearm is carried in a lockable container.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Champagne corks were popping at <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, and after the opening ceremony Biden held a sit-down meeting with a select group. The leaders of <span class="fft-kk">AMD</span>, Nvidia and Apple watched as <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s chairman Mark Liu presented an inscribed wafer to Biden. Such a glossy disc is a standard gift in the chip industry, but it still made Biden glow.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Peter Wennink was seated to the right of the American president. This time, they got his last name correct. When the presidential photographer snapped a picture for Twitter, Wennink stood right next to the American flag, his orange tie hanging neatly parallel to the stars and stripes.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The founder of <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and pioneer of chip technology Morris Chang was also present for the ceremony. He raised a toast to the new factory, but his speech took a somber turn. ‘Globalization is almost dead, as is free trade,’ he observed. Other than the political motivation, he thought it pointless to spread and duplicate chip production across the world. The entire supply chain would have to move along with it, and Chang had little esteem for the Western work ethic. No wonder that <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s American factory was slower to start up than planned. Despite the billions in subsidies, the costs of reshoring led to higher prices. And if manufacturers operated less efficiently, there was less money to invest in innovation. Moore’s Law would also be dead, a victim of the tech war.</p>
