			<p class="ff-platmetwit">A visit to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s main supplier requires traveling further afield: six hundred kilometers to the southeast of Veldhoven to be precise. There, in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, lies the village of Oberkochen, home to the headquarters of German lens manufacturer Carl Zeiss.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When the shuttle from Aalen to Ulm stops at Oberkochen station in the evening, it doesn’t take much to imagine that you’re on vacation. The timber homes, the fresh mountain air: you could easily imagine settling into a German spa, drifting away in seclusion from the bustle of the world. Time seems to stand still in Oberkochen, but make no mistake – a leaflet in the station carries a clue from the Mayor, ‘<span class="fft-cursief">Wir machen Zukunft</span>’: Here, we make the future. This is all because of Zeiss. Known for its microscopes, glasses and camera lenses, the company usually supplies advanced optical equipment to hospitals and universities. But it also makes lens systems for lithography machines. To project the minute pattern of circuits onto the light-sensitive silicon disc, you need a lens that is beyond razor-sharp.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Oberkochen already had a strong tradition of metalworking and mechanical engineering before Zeiss came to town. Extensive mining meant German regions like Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg grew into heavily industrial areas. And as former Zeiss chief Hermann Gerlinger put it, people in these regions don’t get itchy feet. They want to settle into the one company and ‘focus’. This led to a boom in expertise and craftsmanship that stayed local, passed down and built on through the generations that lived and worked in these towns.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Around 150 years prior to this, researcher Carl Zeiss marketed his first microscope from his workshop in the German town of Jena. After the Second World War the city fell under the control of the Russians, however, and would later be demarcated as part of East Germany. Through Zeiss’ supply of lenses to the German army, the Allies had become keenly aware of the company’s strategic importance.<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> troops occupied the Zeiss factory in April 1945 and spent the following three months seizing its patents and tools. By 1946, the Americans had deported over 70 researchers and craftsmen from Zeiss to Heidenheim, then part of the Allied zone. It was from here that they went to work in nearby Oberkochen. The Russians then moved in; just as aware as the Americans of the importance of good lenses and mirrors for their weapons and spy systems, they looted what remained of the Zeiss plant in Jena. Ever since the invention of the binoculars, the optical sector has found itself embroiled in geopolitical maneuvering. Throughout history, any tool that can reveal what the enemy is up to has held immense strategic value.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It didn’t take long in Oberkochen for Zeiss to re-establish itself as a renowned lens factory. In the early 1980s, they landed in the sights of the newcomer <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> as it sought the best glass for its machines. Zeiss SMT, the semiconductor division of the group, would go on to essentially merge with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in all but name.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But as Steef Wittekoek recalls, it was hardly love at first sight. In 1984, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s chief researcher was tasked with persuading Zeiss to make a highly specialized lens with the specifications <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needed. The scientist responsible for the development of the wafer stepper had to convince the reluctant Germans that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was no novice. He’s still not sure which was more challenging.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Exchanges were sharp and laced with skepticism. ‘Are you <span class="fft-cursief">really </span>going to get the lenses for dozens of steppers from us?’ Wittekoek countered: ‘Is your glass supplier <span class="fft-cursief">really</span> good enough?’ The Dutch also needed to see the exact designs of the lenses so they could calibrate the machines to get the best possible image from the glass. Wittekoek put in a request, but the Germans refused. ‘That’s our secret.’ Trust was in short supply, and the two companies needed time to feel the other out.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With the success of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in the years that followed, the mutual dependency between the two companies grew. But the relationship was still fraught with tension. Zeiss’ modus operandi was at complete odds with the volatile behavior of the chip market. Lens production involves months of cycles of measuring, polishing and remeasuring by hand. It asks for time and endless patience, something the engineers in Brabant clearly lacked.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The early days were marked by continuous negotiations, calls and late-night trips between Veldhoven and Oberkochen. Fortunately, there was a good hotel. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers took fondly to Das Goldene Lamm, nestled in nearby Unterkochen. The old brewery from four centuries ago became the place to meet for a beer or bite to eat with their colleagues from Zeiss. Little by little, they learned more about what made their counterparts tick.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, there was a limit to the differences a few beers could absolve. The German tendency for properness and penchant for hierarchy could not be assailed with Dutch directness, and Zeiss’ measured pace of production was completely out of sync with the dynamic nature of the semiconductor industry. Add to this Martin van den Brink’s heated temperament, and it quickly became a recipe for disaster.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the first meetings in Oberkochen, Steef Wittekoek served as a vital intermediary for the ‘hard and volatile’ Van den Brink, who had left the quiet lens experts stunned. ‘For the Germans, it was good that I was there – I was more diplomatic. Seeing there were at least some respectable people at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> made it easier to accept Martin’s abrasive behavior. It was <span class="fft-cursief">Herr van den Brink</span> and <span class="fft-cursief">Herr Doktor Wittekoek</span>. In the end, I was like a guardian angel to him.’</p>
