			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Flashing lights fill Pennsylvania Avenue. Nestled between six police motorbikes, eight black cars, an ambulance and a bus filled with armed officers, the 46<sup class="fft-superscript">th</sup> president of the United States Joe Biden collects his thoughts. It’s just before 8.30 PM on February 7 2023, and the heavily secured convoy is escorting Biden to the Capitol to deliver his State of the Union address. A cold air whips through the fleet as it draws to a halt. It’s time.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To everyone’s surprise, Biden quickly starts talking about the chip shortage that hit the American economy during the pandemic. ‘Cars got more expensive, refrigerators and phones got more expensive,’ he hammers, both index fingers tapping along on the paper in front of him. The implication is clear: keep your hands off American cars and refrigerators, and definitely don’t touch our iPhones.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘That should never happen again. We invented the chip. In recent decades, we have lost our edge. Once we made 40 percent of chips, now only 10 percent. We are going to make sure the supply chain starts again in America.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">He looks up: ‘The supply chain starts in America.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the Dutch embassy in Washington, analysts follow the address keenly. America is in uproar over a Chinese spy balloon shot down over <span class="fft-kk">US</span> territory, yet Biden chooses to first raise the state of the American chip industry. With The Hague eagerly awaiting their briefing that same evening, the analysts take note: 10 minutes and 15 seconds. This is all it took for the president to start talking about the American chip sector and its troubles. In other words, this has just been declared a top priority.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The standing ovation from both Republicans and Democrats lasted exactly 13.5 seconds. Biden knows his history; after all, America was the birthplace of this technology. The transistor was invented in Bell Labs in 1947, and by the late ’50s Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce had soldered the first of their pioneering integrated circuits. These were the glory days of a <span class="fft-kk">US</span> chip industry built exclusively on all-American lithography technology. But it was not to last. With the help of one particular company that came to dominate the lithography market, competitors in the east soon caught up with Silicon Valley. The company was <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Or, as they call it in the corridors of Capitol Hill: <span class="fft-cursief">that company</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, forty years ago <span class="fft-cursief">that company </span>was not yet a reality. What existed was nothing more than a good idea with bad prospects.</p>
