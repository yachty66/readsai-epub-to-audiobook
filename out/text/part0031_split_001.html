			<p class="ff-platmetwit">‘The First Light’. Chip manufacturers love to use this term when they turn on a lithography machine for the first time. It’s a reference to astronomy, usually reserved for telescopes capturing their first murky picture of some distant galaxy. But Hans Meiling doesn’t see any stars. He sees bananas.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It’s January 2006, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s project leader is spending his Saturday reviewing the very first exposed silicon wafer from the alphatool, an early prototype of the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine. In the early days of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> development the lamp was still weak – you could only barely make out the still image from the scanner on the wafer. It looked like a series of fuzzy semi-circles in the vague shape of a banana. Once Meiling noticed this, he couldn’t see anything else.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Hans was one of the driving forces of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>, all the way from its first steps as an ambitious research project right up to the moment the first machines started up in Taiwan and South Korea. He no longer works for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, but still wears a grey sweater with the words ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML, A RELATIVELY OBSCURE COMPANY</span>’ in large print across the chest. The quote from the <span class="fft-kk">BBC</span> holds a special place in his heart: they had no idea just how desperately this obscure company was in search of its ray of light.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Around 2006 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was working on <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> with a team of 275 people, a large part of whom came from Philips, <span class="fft-kk">TNO</span> and Zeiss. The operation was tucked away in a building by Eindhoven airport, which allowed the research group to work on <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> in peace – albeit under the watchful eye of Jos Benschop and Martin van den Brink. As Meiling recalled, ‘The first years were still totally unburdened by commercial pressure; it was wonderful.’ All the time in the world to get absorbed by an overwhelmingly complex task, with nothing to go off but a few assumptions? Sounds like every engineer’s dream. In his words, ‘<span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> was new and hard as hell; everyone wanted to be involved.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But the dream couldn’t last forever, and with the new year came new pressure. Martin wanted to have proof of a functioning machine by February to show at <span class="fft-kk">SPIE</span>, the annual conference for chip manufacturers. Only photos of chip structures with a resolution of less than 40 nanometers would do, but the team were still counting theirs by the hundred. The race was on: Hans Meiling’s team had only a few weeks to whittle this number down and refine the floating bananas into something presentable. Pumped up on adrenaline, the team pushed through long nights to complete a task that would normally take months. On the day of the presentation the latest images arrived from Veldhoven: 35 nanometers. </p>
			<p class="ff-plat">These very first <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines worked with a so-called discharge lamp, which generated such little power it took hours to expose a single wafer. Nevertheless, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> sent alphatools to the research institute imec in Leuven and a lab in Albany, New York. It was only ever a temporary solution: Van den Brink knew the discharge lamp would never be powerful enough for the real job.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘How did we create the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light? By spinning two wheels in a bath of molten tin and adding a spark. If you wanted more light, you needed to spin faster, but this was just like biking quickly through the rain. It splattered in all directions and everything got dirty.’ If <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> wanted to move forward, they needed to find another way.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Hopes fell on Cymer, a San Diego based company that already supplied lasers for conventional lithography machines. Cymer was working on a droplet generator capable of forming a 30-micron droplet of tin at a rate of 50,000 times per second. If you then shoot at it with a heavy <span class="fft-kk">CO</span><sub class="fft-subscript">2</sub> laser in a vacuum, you can create a plasma that radiates that golden wavelength of 13.5 nanometers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">That’s the plan at least. Now they just have to do it in a chip factory.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2004, Intel invested 20 million dollars in Cymer to accelerate development of the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light source. But the company was not in the mood to be rushed: it did not want to be forced into a corner by heavily investing in a shaky technology with only one potential customer, who was from the Netherlands of all places. It was too risky: if they went for it, it would be on their terms.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Meanwhile, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had a not-so-secret weapon to keep its finger on the pulse in San Diego: Steef Wittekoek. The pioneer from the Philips era had been a member of Cymer’s scientific advisory board for the past eight years and had held countless meetings about <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> during that time. He could see San Diego had plenty of smart employees willing to go out on a limb and experiment with interesting ideas, sometimes even with success. But the quality was inconsistent. Industrialization was Cymer’s weak point, as engineers at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> knew too well. The teams were horrified by the prototypes coming in from San Diego: these mechanical aberrations were a stark departure from the technology they were used to getting from their other suppliers. But the challenge of capturing extreme ultraviolet light in a lithography system is hard to match. The machine doesn’t have to be pretty: it just has to work.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Cymer soon discovered that the intensity of the light source increased if you first flatten the droplet into a disc. The laser was now rigged to deal two separate blows. First, a gentle tap to flatten the droplet into a pancake-like shape, followed by an intense blast that heated the tin to two hundred thousand degrees, transforming it into plasma. Impressive, but that was only just the beginning: now they had to figure out how to do this fifty thousand times per second. The laws of physics groaned under the weight of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s progress; every step they took towards making the light source strong and stable was a battle against the limits of what was considered physically possible. Reflection caused a particular set of headaches. As soon as the <span class="fft-kk">CO</span><sub class="fft-subscript">2</sub> laser fired, the tin droplet would bounce a portion of the laser light back, all the way through a few hundred meters of pipes and mirrors to the heart of the laser itself. As soon as it touched that heart, the device would burn out. Game over.</p>
