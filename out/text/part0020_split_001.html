			<p class="ff-platmetwit">‘Do you want me to take over from you?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It was 1997, and Peter Wennink was standing on the golf course with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s financial director Gerard Verdonschot. The released <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> shares had soared in value, meaning the money was no longer some distant promise. With these newfound riches in the palm of his hand, Verdonschot was considering his options carefully.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink, the chartered accountant from Deloitte, could well see himself as financial director in Veldhoven. He was taken by the rawness of the culture at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>: the experience for him was like night and day when compared to the world of accounting and consulting. There, everyone’s only concern was how their own business was doing, and they kept an envious eye on their associates’ turnover. He grew tired of the fragile egos, of being surrounded by smiles from people you knew would gladly take a knife to your back the second it was turned. Make no mistake: at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, you could easily find the wind knocked out of you, but it would be to your face in the middle of the day at a boardroom meeting. And it was never personal – everyone knew where they stood, precisely because <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was never about individuals or about status, but about fulfilling a shared mission.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This was a place where Wennink felt at home. Although hardly tech-savvy, he was at least a quick learner.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Born in 1957, Peter Wennink was raised in the small town of Huizen, set on the shores of the Gooimeer. From its harbor you can easily catch sight of the dikes that line the other side of the lake. These mark the shores of Flevoland – the twelfth province of the Netherlands, wrought from the sea by the Dutch in the ’60s.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Raised in a large Catholic family as one of six children, the path to studying was not a given for Wennink. His father drew electronic circuit diagrams for the Philips branch in Huizen, but his passion was always to work with the land. He instead married a farmer’s daughter, and compensated by spending as much time as possible tending to his garden. He could never quite wrap his head around the world his son moved within or what it meant to be in the upper echelons of corporate life. ‘My friends say that you’re doing something important,’ he would tell his son.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink was taught from an early age to ‘know your place’. ‘Born a dime, never a quarter,’ as his grandmother would say: a Dutch proverb meaning once poor, always poor. The world was divided; it was a simple fact that some were more important than others, and he should be mindful to respect those above him. Aspire beyond your level, and you would only find disappointment. This belief caused great difficulties for the young Wennink, instilling a nervousness that manifested itself in a stammer. As he put it, ‘I had the feeling there was something out there for me, the desire to go be part of something – but also always felt that no matter what I did, I would never truly belong.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At his high school in Bussum, the young Peter received lessons on arithmetic and accounting from a substitute teacher by the name of Rob Boelen. A partner at the accountancy firm Deloitte, he had only taken up the position at the school as a way of avoiding military service, but he immediately recognized the numerical talent of the young student from Huizen. ‘I can still picture him, standing in his shorts in front of the blackboard,’ reflected Boelen. ‘Although he came from a humble background, he was an exceptionally quick learner.’ He asked Peter to join Deloitte once his final exams were over; first as an assistant, but later as a partner.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Peter had his heart set on student life, but a lack of money proved insurmountable. He ended up taking evening classes to become a chartered accountant, before beginning his military service in 1977. Surrounded by soldiers from all walks of life, his eyes were opened to a world beyond the close confines of the Gooi region. As a numbers man, Wennink was given the responsibility of managing the payroll of a company of two hundred soldiers. ‘I always held this sense of responsibility,’ he later reflected. ‘That’s the story of my life.’ Even back home, everyone assumed he was the eldest, despite being the second child. Stepping up to a position of accountability came naturally to him, and he extended his military service by three months.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At Deloitte, he was exposed to an entirely new environment – this was the world of international business. Together with Boelen, Wennink embarked on trips to Arizona and New York to audit <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International’s <span class="fft-kk">US</span> reports. In this life of chartered accountants, evenings were for fine dining and lofty conversations with clients. Peter had no trouble adapting to this, with the pleasure-seeker in him quickly taking to the newfound freedom. He lived for good food and drink, learning to cook with great flair. He also had an affinity for fine wine, a hobby he took to the moment he first tasted wine at his high school graduation party (from a box, admittedly, but still from a good year). The first check he ever wrote from his Deloitte salary went to a restaurant, and the second to a liquor store.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Boelen taught Wennink the ins and outs of good leadership. Essential to making your life easier was to delegate, to surround yourself with people that would become better at what they did than you ever could. Yet Boelen also learned from his apprentice, who had a gift in dealing with people. ‘Peter knows how to listen: it was entirely from him that I picked up the art of having patience with people. I was always taught to be strict, but he was more empathetic, more light-hearted.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, despite standing at 1.96 meters tall, Wennink still acted with his colleagues at Deloitte as if it was he who needed to look up to them. Whether this was a hangover from his upbringing or due to the stammer that plagued him, the hierarchical nature of the company only exacerbated this feeling. This didn’t go unnoticed by Rob Boelen. ‘He would insist on calling me “Mr. Boelen”, and I would always tell him, “Peter, please, stop calling me that.”’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In late 1994, Wennink heard that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> wanted to go public. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was wholly owned by Philips, so it seemed certain the latter’s accountant <span class="fft-kk">KPMG</span> would be the one to lead the <span class="fft-kk">IPO</span>. But Wennink sensed an opportunity. Seizing the moment, he bluffed his way through the selection committee with a hastily prepared presentation and a fictional team of employees, and landed the assignment for Deloitte. He had never done an <span class="fft-kk">IPO</span> before, and lacked the papers to arrange a <span class="fft-kk">NASDAQ</span> listing. But with months of hard work, and a hefty dose of luck, in 1995 the <span class="fft-kk">IPO</span> was successful. That one bluff, the one moment he believed in himself the same way that he looked at others, determined the rest of his career. Proof that a dime can become a quarter after all.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Rob Boelen set about preparing his apprentice to become chairman of the partnership, the highest position at Deloitte Netherlands. But midway through an assessment review, Wennink dropped the news: he would be joining <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Boelen tried to talk him out of it, but it was a lost cause. The decision was made. ‘He got the bug. I had to let him go.’</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Henk Bodt, chairman of the supervisory board at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, noticed that he didn’t just have a new numbers man in Wennink, but also someone who could quickly build relationships and was talented in communicating with customers. The new ‘relationship man’ Wennink was immediately put to work; talking to the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>s of chip manufacturers along with Martin van den Brink and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s new British chief executive Doug Dunn. Getting things done requires making acquaintances, listening, gaining trust. This is how deals are closed – and these were all qualities that came natural to him. Dunn, the successor to Willem Maris, could also see his talent. ‘Peter is a creative businessman. I always knew he would eventually lead <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink felt liberated by the culture at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. No one set themselves above another, and everyone, including the leaders, were held accountable. He even stopped stuttering. ‘Within <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, it’s all about humility. It’s not about you, but the bigger goal we all want to achieve together.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Nonetheless, for the first year he still steered well clear of Van den Brink, who didn’t spare anyone from his painfully aggressive outbursts. All Wennink could say was: <span class="fft-cursief">‘He scares the freaking hell out of you</span>.’</p>
