			<p class="ff-platmetwit">‘You’re not talking to me like that, are you? Sir?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The patience of the German police officer had run thin. He was looking at a totally unconcerned Hermann Gerlinger who was too busy yelling into his phone at Martin van den Brink. Their argument had started while the Zeiss <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> was behind the wheel, spilling over into an all-out shouting match even as the policeman ordered him out of the car.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Just give me the damn ticket,’ snapped Gerlinger as he pulled his papers out from his glove box. All the while, he continued his spat with Van den Brink, who was giving it back in German just as hard from over in Veldhoven.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The officer had enough. ‘Hang up. Now.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘One moment, Martin, I’m putting you on mute,’ said Gerlinger. One tap and Veldhoven fell silent – no need to wait for a response. A few minutes and one fine later, the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> was back behind the wheel and on his way. He whipped out his phone and hit unmute. ‘<span class="fft-cursief">So ein Scheiss</span>. Total waste of time. Now, where were we…’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Sparks never failed to fly when the technical directors of Zeiss and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> crossed wires. They both lived for head-on confrontations, as they thought all good engineers should. That much at least was clear. Later, they would fondly laugh about the incident over dinner, brushing away any notion of ill feeling. ‘You’ll never survive in this business without humor,’ Gerlinger said as he stepped down as head of Zeiss’ semiconductor division in 2016.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">As intense as the interactions between researchers on the optical systems were, the commercial relationship between Zeiss and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had turned cold. The problems escalated sharply following Dunn’s exit in 2004. When his term as <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> ended, he elected to draw his pension, spending the rest of his time taking supervisory positions at chip companies. And so Veldhoven swapped the Brit for a Frenchman by the name of Eric Meurice. Previously an employee of Intel and computer manufacturer Dell, he had moved over from his position as vice president at French electronics manufacturer Thomson. He took pride in being able to tell people they were ‘incompetent’ in whatever language they preferred. It was a term employees at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would soon hear echoing the hallways on a regular basis, especially in discussions about Zeiss. A significant rift had formed between the longstanding partners as they once again found themselves embroiled in a row that was, as always, about money.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Once again, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> wanted to double its revenue in the coming years and needed Zeiss to up its production of lenses to do so. However, Zeiss refused to let <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s rose-tinted forecasts pull the wool over their eyes. Memories of Doug Dunn’s merciless canceling of orders during the crises of 2001 and 2002 were still fresh, and the acquisition of the American <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> in the meantime had not helped smooth things over. <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> also manufactured lenses, leaving Zeiss with serious questions about the exclusivity of their partnership with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. The take-over had opened a door for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> they would have much rather seen remain closed.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Suspicion hung heavy in the air. With the trust broken, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> summoned a mediator: Guido Groet. Although now working at Meta, the technology company behind Facebook, in 2004 he had just returned to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> from the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> after managing the sale of surplus parts of <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span>. After spending his first year in Veldhoven overseeing cuts as part of the expensive TwinScan production, a new task awaited him: bonding.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Groet was called to the twentieth floor. There, Martin van den Brink and financial director Peter Wennink laid out their woes regarding the fractured relationship between <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Zeiss. For Wennink it was simple: ‘We need you to get<span class="fft-kk"> </span>us working well together, in good balance with one another.’ But Van den Brink saw things slightly differently: ‘Make sure they don’t keep tricking us.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To save their ailing partnership, Zeiss and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> underwent a series of intensive meetings between 2005 and 2007, with Peter Wennink attending a commercial consultation in Oberkochen every three months on behalf of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. In addition, every quarter there was an ‘interface’ meeting directly about the technical cooperation between the two companies. These would alternate between Veldhoven and Oberkochen, and occasionally taking place at a neutral point halfway – typically a hotel in Frankfurt.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Mending such a break requires first bringing the fracture to light. Small teams from each company were brought together to air their grievances. As might be expected, the Dutch had no qualms putting their problems straight on the table. But with a little encouragement the Germans did the same, and the teams were then encouraged to present the reconciliation jointly to the entire management.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But Groet soon found he had been tasked with bringing together two vastly different companies. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> attracted cowboys who wanted to shoot faster than their shadows, while Zeiss fancied itself a traditional scientific institute, taking time to think through all the variables before even considering acting. This was a recipe for trouble. Employees collided on all fronts, and the search for a common ground proved an endless task. Especially when the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers had a tendency to change course without consultation after the meetings had taken place. This drove the Germans mad.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Dieter Kurz, boss of the overarching Carl Zeiss AG, took up regular attendance on behalf of the Germans while Eric Meurice represented <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Guido Groet would record the agreements made during the meetings on a large screen so everyone could read along. Childish, but at this point any measure that could minimize misunderstandings was welcomed. Not that it helped; upon sending his first minutes to Meurice, he quickly received back a heavily redacted version with a note at the bottom: ‘You still have a lot to learn, kid. Don’t write down what was said, but what was meant.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Zeiss, as ever, disagreed. With the management teams once again at each other’s throats, the meeting had to be entirely redone as if it were a retake of at test in high school. As the two sides assembled once more, Groet kept a low profile while his bosses battled it out. He did so on the good advice of a colleague from Zeiss: when the elephants dance, you shouldn’t stand between them.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Zeiss and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> continued to bicker about who deserved what and if everyone was getting what they were entitled to. And the amounts under discussion were significant; in 2004, the value of the optics accounted for around a quarter of the worth of a lithography machine. Martin van den Brink was particularly irritated that Zeiss was unwilling to give guarantees on lenses costing millions of euros. If a chip manufacturer discovered optical errors that were hampering production, it was up to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to cough up the costs.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For their part, the Germans figured they were the ones running the risks while <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> banked the rewards. Veldhoven could quickly up production by bringing in new people or asking existing workers to stay longer at the factories, but the timescales for a lens manufacturer were far different. Zeiss had admittedly solved one serious bottleneck for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in the ’90s when they switched from polishing by hand to using robots for the task. But still, glass for crystal must first ‘grow’, and investment for raw materials needed to be done at least three years in advance. Polishing and measuring the lenses was an equally laborious task, neither of which gained any speed by simply throwing more people at it. As the sages at Zeiss were fond of saying: a pregnancy lasts nine months, and it won’t go any faster if you put an extra woman next to you.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Sore spots continued to emerge: <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was used to promising chipmakers significant discounts to bring in deals. However, Zeiss would then also need to offer discounts on the lens, otherwise the cost would be sunk from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s profit margin, which was hardly flourishing to begin with. The Germans were also completely unwilling to accustom themselves to the wild market fluctuations of the chip industry, always pushing a fixed price for their products. But as Groet knew too well, the world they moved in was full of ‘enormous whiners, constantly pushing for discounts and always complaining about the quality.’ Nobody cared to conform to what Zeiss wanted.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Ultimately, the crux of the matter boiled down to one key question: could <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Zeiss share the risks and profits fairly? Groet brought in a mathematician to crunch the numbers, and after two years of agonizing negotiations, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Zeiss finally agreed and signed a new contract in 2007. They could now regulate guarantees and sudden adjustments in orders. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> agreed to pre-finance a third of the value of the lenses, meaning Zeiss ran less risk when purchasing materials.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink sought an end to the never-ending conflicts and floated the idea of taking over Zeiss. But this was unthinkable for the Germans: the lenses they made for lithography machines were their crown jewels. And so there would never be an official bid. Zeiss, solely owned by the Carl Zeiss Foundation, also kept <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and their money at arm’s length on matters of expansions and real estate. There was to be no Dutch hand in the German kitchen – for now.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The technical consultation rounds between Zeiss and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> were dominated by Van den Brink. These meetings saw numbers of fifty persons from each company attend, arranged in a single horseshoe shape across the room with their eyes locked on each other. The engineers took it in turns to give presentations while the technical director had his nose cemented to his computer, his eyes only occasionally glancing up at the mention of a topic that caught his ear. Postures would stiffen as the room fell still: Martin had been roused.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The teams at Zeiss would balk the second Van den Brink’s temper got out of hand, despite this being both inevitable and frequent. But his technical and strategic insight garnered a high level of respect, and the outbursts became accepted as evidence of his intense commitment to Zeiss. As Guido Groet saw, this was not wishful thinking; ‘Martin would unleash a whirlwind of fury if I hadn’t been over to Oberkochen for two or three weeks. He also thought I should be speaking German, as I’d then better understand what they meant.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘If I’m angry at a German, I’ll swear at them in German,’ Martin would later confide. ‘It’s the better way to get the message across.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The closer you get to the work floor, the more Zeiss and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> start to feel like one company. Project teams are a mix of Brabanders and Germans, with dozens of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> personnel at work in Oberkochen each day. Together, they set about building the heart of a highly complex machine, a process that cultivates a bond between both sides of the aisle. After a long day, the engineers often come together at Landgasthof LäuterHäusle, where the Dutch invasion joins their Zeiss colleagues in raiding the salad bar.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Despite this, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s most important supplier continued to prove a weak link in the chain. In 2007, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> found itself prey to furious chip manufacturers who had not received their ordered TwinScan machines. Veldhoven had done their part: fifty machines were ready to be shipped, except for one vital part. This time the illuminator was to blame, the component that guides the laser in the machine, manufactured by Zeiss in the town of Wetzlar, just north of Frankfurt.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Tempers were high and everyone was quick to point the finger, but the cause of the delay remained unclear. ‘Why are you not already in Wetzlar helping them?’ Van den Brink snapped at the startled Groet. It was an order hardly disguised as a question. So Guido Groet immediately took himself to Germany, camping out for a month to find the kink in the cable. The trail eventually led to delays with a special optical filter, only available from one source in Russia.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Groet flew to confront the supplier: ‘Where are those filters, everyone is waiting for you!’ But the Russians were completely nonplussed by the problems they were causing. ‘Every time we ship something to Germany, we need to bribe a customs officer. So, we save the filters until we have fifty, then we only need to do it that once.’</p>
