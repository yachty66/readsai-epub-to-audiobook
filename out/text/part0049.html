			<p class="ff-platmetwit">‘We can’t hide our wealth any longer.’ You can hear the regret in Martin van den Brink’s voice. He looks out of his window over all the factories, offices and construction cranes stretching into the distance. The new buildings seem quite chic to him. Sure, the design could have been slightly different, but he can’t meddle in everything.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink’s office on the twentieth floor is the perfect place to see how <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is expanding. Or, better yet: exploding. An American-style campus surrounds the tower, complete with a lively restaurant, an auditorium with a rooftop garden, a private supermarket, a bright blue running track and ‘recharge rooms’ for reading, gaming or knitting. You could live your entire life and never have to leave the campus.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2023, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has over 42,000 employees and is ranked among the fifty most valuable companies in the world. This is a two-fold increase from six years earlier. Over 20,000 people work in Veldhoven, and this number is expected to double again over the next six years. Taking the suppliers into account, this means an additional 70,000 jobs for the Brabant region. This impossible growth is more concerning to ASML than the political turmoil captivating the outside world. In Veldhoven’s eyes, they have better things to do than be sidetracked by geopolitics. The only way is up, and delays are not an option.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Over the course of forty years, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has undergone a remarkable transformation. What began as a start-up became a scale-up, emerged as a market leader and cemented its place as a monopolist. Even in the middle of the escalating tech war between the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and China, its expansion is unrelenting. The demand for chips exploded in the wake of the energy transition and AI revolution, which has left the world wanting one thing: more chip machines. Companies such as Nvidia are relying entirely on <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, and are struggling to produce enough processors to provide the computing power needed by Chat<span class="fft-kk">GPT</span> and its derivative applications. Analysts predict that the global chip market will double in size and become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030. And this translates directly into <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s order books.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">These orders are the responsibility of sales director Sunny Stalnaker, a veteran when it comes to closing billion-dollar deals with chip manufacturers. But even someone as skilled as Sunny has found her craft pushed to the limit.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The year is 2017, and Martin van den Brink has just asked Stalnaker to make an agreement with Intel on the purchase of High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines. The future of his <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> master plan rests on that single order. All Stalnaker has to do is find a way to bridge the half-a-billion-dollar difference in asking price.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It should have been an impossible task. At this point, the High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machine only exists on paper, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is still struggling to get its regular <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines to work properly. ‘We didn’t even know ourselves when things would finally start to work,’ Stalnaker quips. Nevertheless, her powers of persuasion bring Intel on board, and the other chip manufacturers soon follow suit. Mission accomplished, future secured.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But as soon as <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> gains momentum, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s problems begin. Surprisingly, it is a sudden demand for deep ultraviolet machines that catches <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> off guard. For years, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has been producing around two hundred of these systems annually. It is expected that the demand for these immersion scanners will drop off once <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> hits the market, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has already retrained its factory workers accordingly. But reality is taking a different turn. In 2020, Sunny Stalnaker watches the orders for <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> quadruple to almost two hundred per quarter. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is overwhelmed – it is simply far too many for them to make, although Martin van den Brink struggles to see the problem. ‘What is so difficult about scaling up?’ he sighs to a colleague. ‘Just do the same thing as usual times two or three.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One of the causes of the uptick in orders is the shift in strategy from the Chinese government. Under pressure due to the American export regulations, China has decided to embrace established chip technology, using <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> machines. With cars evolving into computers on wheels, these less advanced chips are in high demand. Meanwhile, the demand for <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> scanners keeps growing. Stalnaker’s order book, already worth tens of billions of euros, is overflowing. And just to make things even more complicated: to produce <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> chips, you also need more <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> machines to expose the less critical layers in a chip. And so demand keeps going up.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It’s a perfect storm, and it is hitting Veldhoven right in the middle of a pandemic.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The unprecedented success of the company has come around to bite itself in the tail. In 2021, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is only able to deliver two thirds of the machines ordered for that year. You can feel the pressure in the overcrowded factories, in the overworked logistics organization, and in the atmosphere around Veldhoven. The employees’ workloads are increasing – despite hundreds of new colleagues joining every month – and construction cranes become a familiar sight at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s branches abroad and within their network of suppliers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">There is no longer any doubt about <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s critical role in the manufacturing industry. A new economic wonder has risen from the ashes of Philips and become the foundation of the so-called ‘Brainport’ region, the high-tech area of the Netherlands. But the province of Brabant is beginning to groan under the weight of the prosperity, whether on the highways around Eindhoven, in the exploding labor market or at the overcrowded housing market.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When it comes to scaling down chips, there is nothing left for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to learn. But growing your organization at this scale without losing yourself – that’s a different story.</p>
