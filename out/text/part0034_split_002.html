			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The risks were piling up for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Even though the regular <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine was still not functional, preparations were already underway for the next generation of machines, the so-called High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> systems. This required a multi-billion-euro investment from Zeiss, as the lens manufacturer had to build a whole new factory and fill it with extremely expensive equipment to meet the new technical demands.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, these plans didn’t leave <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s supervisory board jumping with joy. They were hesitant to invest in yet another non-functional machine. Nonetheless, Wennink and Van den Brink managed to secure approval, and in November 2016 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> invested one billion euros for 24.9 percent stake in Carl Zeiss SMT, the semiconductor division of the lens manufacturer. With this investment, the Germans had access to 760 million euros to develop the next generation of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> mirrors in Oberkochen. They could start pouring the slabs, and the engineers were already licking their lips at the prospect of their new futuristic playground.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But Martin van den Brink faced another challenge. He needed to immediately start looking for customers for the new machine, which at this stage was only a blueprint. In 2017, he arranged for a private tour of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam so he could speak with the chip manufacturers among the sunflowers. But Samsung had no interest in a High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machine. ‘Make sure you get the promised 100-watt light source up and running first. Then we’ll talk,’ the Koreans responded.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the end of that year, Wennink and Van den Brink flew to South Korea for a meeting with Kinam Kim, the head of Samsung’s semiconductor division. As they stepped off the plane, Martin glanced at his phone. Grinning like the Cheshire Cat, he showed the message to Wennink. It was an email from the Australian engineer Danny Brown, radiating relief: ‘We have 100 watts!’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">San Diego had finally pulled through. But to truly convince Samsung, they needed to have an <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light source fully up and running in Korea, not just in some shaky testing system on the other side of the world. And the collector, the mirror that captures the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light, was still getting contaminated far too often. That is simply not workable in a chip factory that needs to run around the clock. ‘So really, we did not have anything,’ said Van den Brink. He was never one to count his chickens before they hatched.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">One Saturday morning just before Christmas, Samsung’s technology chief arrived in Veldhoven. He wanted to see results. ‘You go on ahead,’ Van den Brink had to tell his wife. He was about to leave with his family on a ski vacation, but the light source was still malfunctioning. Desperate to find a solution, the technical director and his teams in San Diego held daily calls with Martin to solve the issue of the blackened mirrors. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had until March 2018 to get Samsung’s machine working, but there was no good news to give the visitor. Meanwhile, another deadline was fast approaching: Van den Brink had promised the supervisory board he would secure orders for the High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machines before the first of the year, otherwise his plan would halt. A request for a three-month extension was made: one more quarter to decide the commercial fate of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. Van den Brink didn’t dare provide any guarantees about its success. He could already hear the smug analysts taunting him all over again.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the meantime, Intel was actually considering buying a set of High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machines, but the asking price was half a billion dollars higher than what the Americans were willing to pay. Van den Brink’s jaw hit the floor. ‘Holy cow. Well, if you guys really want those machines, we’ll split the difference.’ Intel agreed, although the details still needed to be worked out. Van den Brink rallied his sales team; they needed to bulldoze this enormous financial hurdle as soon as possible, and with that he set off to Taiwan to reel in the next High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> customer.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At first, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> showed no interest in this newest generation of machines. But when Van den Brink and Wennink flew together to Taipei in February, the Taiwanese were convinced. ‘It’s a leap of faith, but we’re jumping together,’ Wennink poetically promised them. That very line persuaded Morris Chang to purchase <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s first <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines. And if the implementation of new technology proved a challenge, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would ensure that backup machines or alternatives were available to keep production going.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Samsung proved to be a tougher case. The Koreans had been waiting seven years for a working <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine, and they were out of patience. Martin van den Brink wrote a personal email to Kinam Kim: ‘Give<span class="fft-kk"> </span>us one more month – just until April. Then it’ll happen.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A completely coincidental discovery pushed <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> over the tipping point. In February 2018, an engineer noticed something strange: ‘Isn’t it odd how the mirror becomes clean again when we open the vacuum system to change parts?’ Antoine Kempen, a chemist on the team, had an explanation: it was likely because of oxygen entering. A rapid series of tests followed, and their suspicions were confirmed: if you add a bit of oxygen to the vacuum in addition to the hydrogen, the mirror of the light source stays functional far longer.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the end of March, Van den Brink traveled to Korea to show that <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> was ready for production. ‘We didn’t tell Samsung anything, only that the machine needed a tiny upgrade. One extra pipe with oxygen, and the problem was solved.’ Satisfied with the result, Samsung immediately signed the contract for the High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink awarded Antoine Kempen the honorary title of ‘fellow’ for ‘groundbreaking work in the fight against contamination in <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> technology.’ Thanks to his little puff of oxygen, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> could breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
