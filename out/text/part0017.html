			<p class="ff-platmetwit">A face full of fresh sea air can do wonders for new ideas.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is springtime 1989, the year in which the Iron Curtain will fall, and the leadership of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is spending a weekend sailing on the Wadden Sea. As soon as the boat clears Harlingen harbor in the north of the Netherlands, a punishing headwind blows the entire management to the first buoy, sending them straight back to square one. They try not to read into it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Reconvening under the hold to wait out the weather, they discuss <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s fragile position. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> wants to get ahead of the Japanese, but something needs to change if they are to take the wind out of market leader Nikon’s sails. Until now, the Dutch have only supplied chip manufacturers just below the top of the market like Micron, <span class="fft-kk">AMD</span> and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, and sales are still small enough that any crisis could be the last. The big players like Motorola, Intel or <span class="fft-kk">IBM</span> (the inventor of the personal computer) will need to see something truly special if they are to be won over, and the technology <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has in-house is not enough to catch the interest of these chipmakers. Sales director Dick Aurelio knows this, and so, huddled in the belly of the boat, the question is put to leadership: ‘Is there <span class="fft-cursief">anything</span> we can do to stand out and beat the Japanese?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">They may not know it yet, but the winds have already changed – a young engineer and project leader by the name of Martin van den Brink has been working on something new.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Coming up with memorable product names has never been <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s strong suit. To outsiders, they read as nothing more than a random assortment of numbers and letters. But if the name of any device deserves to be remembered, then it is this one: the <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 5500. This lithography machine turned out to be <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s salvation, a lifeline for a company in danger of going under. And to this day the machine seems unstoppable; even thirty years later, the <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 5500’s are still stamping chips.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">These machines were the first in the industry to utilize modular design. Broken down into roughly ten components, each of these parts are independently manufactured until, like pieces of a puzzle, they are clicked together in the factory to form a single working system. The lens, the wafer-table, the frame for the mask, the light source, the robot that picks the wafers: these are the Lego blocks that, when you bring them together, form a lithography system.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The individual modules are produced in series, making it easier to upgrade individual designs and swap out components at will. This way the machine you buy is never the final product: every part of the machine can be continually improved upon. Just like ratcheting in a new, more powerful engine for your car instead of forking out for a new one.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> set about building a prototype of the <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 5500 in the spring of 1991. All the while, <span class="fft-kk">IBM</span> kept a watchful eye on them. The big player from the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> didn’t dare blindly trust the unknown Dutch company, sending instead a bimonthly delegation to Veldhoven to inspect the progress. As February rolled around, Martin van den Brink, the architect of this machine, called his team together. <span class="fft-kk">IBM</span> were about to do their last round of inspections. The plan: ten project leaders would present their module, after which a team would take these units and assemble the machine on the spot. Et voilà – a <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 5500, ready to start spitting out wafers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But three days before they were due to arrive, a call from <span class="fft-kk">IBM</span> came through. A war in Iraq was looming, and with the announcement of Operation Desert Storm, American companies were banning their employees from flying internationally. Van den Brink could see where this was going. <span class="fft-kk">IBM</span> would play it safe, staying with their Japanese competitor and leaving his project in the dust.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">He refused to let that happen. That same weekend he recorded videos of Veldhoven’s work and took the whole team to <span class="fft-kk">IBM</span>’s factory in Fishkill, New York, in a last-ditch attempt to salvage a deal. If they could not come to him, he would bring it to them – after all, the Dutch were not affected by the American flight ban. The stunt was a success; the video was enough to win over ‘Big Blue’. The first big player was in.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, 1991 and 1992 proved to be a financial disaster for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. The company sold only 36 lithography machines, nowhere near enough to offset the spiraling development costs of the <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 5500. The project teams, spurred on by Van den Brink, were burning through far more money than <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> could afford. And by this time, he had already built a reputation as someone who not only refused to shy away from confrontation, but actively sought it out. It was his way of keeping people on their toes. As his former colleague Nico Hermans put it, ‘Martin is quite unique, if a little autistic at times. But if you gain his trust, he will accomplish remarkable things.’</p>
