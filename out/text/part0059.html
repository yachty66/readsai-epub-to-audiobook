			<p class="ff-platmetwit">How do you paint a picture of the world of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> – a company located in Veldhoven in the rural Dutch province of Brabant, a company that also makes the most complex machine on earth?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It started by doing tons of research. This book came to be through more than three hundred interviews and reports over the course of more than ten years. The past three years I was able to follow <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> behind the scenes. I travelled to Asia and the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, and had many talks with presidents Martin van den Brink and Peter Wennink and other <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> executives.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In addition, I met with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> pioneers from the early days, visited the network of suppliers and customers, and talked with stakeholders in Washington, Brussels and The Hague, who helped me to reconstruct the geopolitical powerplay around the company from an insider’s perspective. I am very grateful that they confided in me about this sensitive material.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To check the facts and to put all elements into perspective, I also conducted background conversations with people at different levels, who are at, or are closely connected to, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. The reconstructions of events have been verified by multiple independent sources. Some fragments of the book have been previously published by the Dutch paper <span class="fft-kk">NRC</span>, and for ease of reading, only external sources are named in the running text.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">This book has been an autonomous venture, made possible in part by the Dutch Fund for In-depth Journalism (<span class="fft-kk">FBJP</span>). <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> did not financially contribute but did cooperate with an independent profile. After all, the company is proud of its success and not afraid of any type of confrontation. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> inspired me to paint an honest picture of its internal operations, and of the unusual world in which it functions.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Team members helped me in setting up many company visits and interviews, but did not interfere with the content of talks, or the text. Although <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> assisted in checking the facts afterwards, I am responsible for any mistakes. Special thanks to Monique Mols, Ryan Young and former board member Frits van Hout, who took on the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> archives and helped to explain complicated technology in simpler terms.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Thank you to my advance readers for your critical eye, and Roel Venderbosch for your infographics, Henk van Renssen, Igor Damen and Karin Kreuk at Balans Publishers, and to the editors at <span class="fft-kk">NRC</span> who gave me the opportunity to immerse myself into the topic – to focus, one could say. Multiple colleagues helped me to sharpen my thoughts, and so thank you to Garrie van Pinxteren, Clara van de Wiel, and Maarten Schinkel, Michel Kerres and Stijn Bronzwaer.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For the English translation I would like to thank Mark Whittle and ‘pink pen-ther’ Dorien Muijzer. But I could have never completed this project without the unwavering support of my partner-in-crime, Lotte.</p>
