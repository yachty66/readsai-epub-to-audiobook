			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Oerle, Zeelst, Meerveldhoven: nestled between these tongue-twisting tiny townships in the municipality of Veldhoven, a powerful monopoly was emerging. Years of investment in an improbable technology was yielding serious results, and in 2017 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> reported over a billion euros in revenue from the new <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines. Meanwhile, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s market share in conventional lithography systems had climbed to 90 percent.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One company had been watching this rise through gritted teeth: Nikon. Right up until the ’90s, the Japanese technology group had been the market leader in lithography machines – until <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> came, saw and conquered. But there is still a way to turn things around when you’ve been kicked off the throne: sue the new king.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In April 2017, Nikon initiated another patent lawsuit against <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. To their dismay, Carl Zeiss SMT, the German lens maker’s semiconductor division, was also dragged in. The Japanese accused them of violating eleven patents in the Netherlands and filed simultaneous complaints in Germany and Japan. If the courts ruled in Nikon’s favor, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would have to cease the production of machines in Veldhoven. Once again, the survival of the company was at stake. Market leader or not, a looming ban on production was the last thing they needed. But this time, the attack did not come as a surprise.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> still vividly remembered Nikon’s claims from 2001. That lawsuit came out of the blue and ended in 2004 with a so-called cross-licensing agreement. Nikon, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Zeiss effectively signed a ceasefire so they could continue using each other’s technologies without being dragged to court. The deal cost <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> 87 million dollars and Zeiss had to pay Nikon another 58 million dollars.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Part of the cross-licensing agreement expired in 2009, and when <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> reached out to discuss an extension, the Japanese were silent. In 2013, as the remaining agreements were about to expire, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> knocked on Tokyo’s door again. Once again, Nikon didn’t respond. The Dutch were willing to pay a reasonable amount to continue the licenses, but Nikon wasn’t interested in an extension of the existing deal. It wanted a chunk of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s revenue. In 2017, this amounted to more than 9 billion euros. Nikon was looking to receive potentially hundreds of millions of euros it would then be able to use to recoup its own lithography research costs. The Japanese <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> project had stalled in 2009, effectively gifting <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> a monopoly over these machines. A lingering resentment had simmered among the Japanese ever since: they had failed to win the first patent battle, and it had cost them their leading market position.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Veldhoven, in turn, harbored a strong antipathy towards anything even remotely associated with the Japanese competition. You wouldn’t see the old-school <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers with a Canon or Nikon camera. They would rather buy an Olympus or Sony – after all, Japan did produce the best cameras in the world.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This gave Eric Maurice an idea – and a brilliant one, he might add. In 2011, two years before the Frenchman stepped down as <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>, he approached Martin van den Brink with a plan. As soon as the Japanese filed their first complaint about lithography machines, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> should use camera patents to hit Nikon where it hurt the most. Meurice could feel the storm brewing, and he gave a stark warning to Van den Brink: ‘You’re gonna have a problem Martin, that’s why you need to attack them on their own turf. Make sure you get those patents.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink often clashed with Meurice, but he knew the Frenchman was clever. He took the warning to heart and consulted with Ton van Hoef, who managed <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s lithography patent portfolio. Patents needed to be acquired, and preferably not in plain sight.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">According to the database on company.info, in October 2011, a company called Tarsium B.V. was established. It was a shell company set up by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to stay under the radar of Nikon’s lawyers. On paper, Tarsium was officially registered in Amsterdam and in a residential area in Eindhoven. The name appeared to be derived from ‘tarsier’, the wide-eyed nocturnal primate native to islands of Southeast Asia that hunts insects under the cover of darkness. Between 2012 and 2014, Tarsium acquired nearly 10 million euros’ worth of patents for digital photography, including from Hewlett-Packard, Xerox, MediaTek, and the American patent aggregator Intellectual Ventures. The first patent, obtained in November 2012, described a method for selecting faces in an image. Convenient for quickly snapping a group shot.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When the cross-licensing deal expired in 2014, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> enlisted the help of Willem Hoyng, partner in Amsterdam-based law firm Hoyng Rokh Monegier and specialist in intellectual property. The conflict with Nikon became the biggest case of his fifty-year career. Hoyng quietly set about assembling a team of twenty lawyers, and for a time, everything remained calm. In 2015 and 2016, mediation attempts between <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Nikon once again failed, and the inevitable legal battle ensued. The new patent war had started, and as soon as Nikon fired its first shot on April 24, 2017, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> deployed its secret weapon. On April 28, Tarsium transferred the accumulated patents to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Zeiss, and on the same day, those companies sued Nikon.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The outside world was surprised to hear the counterclaim also targeted cameras. Wasn’t this all about lithography? <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> Peter Wennink denied that Veldhoven was infringing on Japanese patents, explaining <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s counterclaim in a press release: ‘We have no other choice but to file these lawsuits. Nikon never took the negotiations seriously. We will defend ourselves with every means at our disposal.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The lawsuits were beginning to stack up globally. But first, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had to defend itself against the Japanese allegations in the Netherlands. Willem Hoyng went to meet with Martin van den Brink. Right away, Martin asked him, ‘Ah, so you’re the famous lawyer – what chance do we have of winning these cases?’ Hoyng estimated perhaps as high as 80 percent. Van den Brink exploded. ‘We have more than fifteen cases going on. Have you calculated what 80 percent of 80 percent of 80 percent is? Keep going and I won’t be able to pay you by the end of it all. I want the fifteenth root of 80 percent! Until then you’ll be here every Friday afternoon to keep me up to date.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And so nearly every Friday, just as requested, the lawyers met at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Meetings with the intellectual property department took place first, followed by a mandatory brainstorming session in Van den Brink’s office. They figured it was not in Nikon’s interest to actually shut down <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s production: they just wanted money. A lot of it. But Martin van den Brink wasn’t about to let himself get cornered by a competitor.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Dutch judge saw the stack of cases on his desk grow by the day, filled with words like ‘onderdompelinglithografiebelichtingsinrichting’, the 46-letter Dutch word for an immersion lithography exposure device. Exasperated, he summoned the lawyers of both parties. If this was just about money, surely it could all be resolved a bit faster. He forced a discussion between Nikon and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, but Nikon had no intentions to negotiate: they wanted to win a case first so they could corner <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and ask for more money. The subsequent meeting in San Francisco lasted less than two hours, and the lawyers were on a flight back to Amsterdam that same day.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The first four of the Dutch patent cases ruled in favor of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Zeiss. But this was no cause for celebration. The company was on the line with every case: lose just one of the next hearings and they would lose everything. Zeiss, now fully intertwined with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, was the most concerned. The companies were united in their legal battle against Nikon, but they were dependent on the tempo of the court, which was progressing at a snail’s pace, according to Van den Brink. In a patent dispute, you need momentum to force a breakthrough.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A year and half later, the breakthrough finally came. In August 2018, the American International Trade Commission ruled that Nikon had infringed upon the camera patents owned by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Zeiss. Suddenly, Nikon’s camera division was facing an American import ban, and the Japanese were getting nervous.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As the complaining party to the <span class="fft-kk">ITC</span>, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Zeiss had to demonstrate that they were suffering real economic damage, which meant there needed to be a camera available for sale in the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> that used the patented parts. To everyone’s surprise, in the fall of 2018, Zeiss announced the ZX1. It was a compact digital camera with a fixed lens and large touchscreen: jet black, angular, with built-in photo editing software and internet connection. There was even a catchy slogan: ‘Shoot, Edit, Share’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The industry press was perplexed. When Zeiss had last made cameras, they still required roll film. Digital camera sales had plummeted since the iPhone’s arrival, with most people just using their phones to take photos. Was Zeiss seriously planning on entering this declining market now?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Zeiss promised the ZX1 would be available in early 2019 – although they refused to reveal the price. A team from the American division built some prototypes, and Zeiss announced the ZX1 at the Photokina fair in Frankfurt. It was a grand affair, with the employees welcoming the gathered media with applause. It was like the world had been turned upside down. In December, a YouTube video appeared featuring a German photographer trying out the ZX1 for the first time, taking snapshots while wandering around the sushi shops in the Little Tokyo district of Düsseldorf. Another jab at the Japanese.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Nikon became concerned. With four lost cases and a threat from the <span class="fft-kk">ITC</span> to their name, the Japanese buckled and decided they wanted to negotiate a new agreement at a more reasonable rate. The parties were brought together by Edward Infante, the American judge who handled the previous confrontation between Nikon and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. On January 23, 2019, Nikon, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, and Carl Zeiss released a joint statement to the press: the deal was done. The Germans and Dutch paid Nikon 150 million euro (of which <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> paid 131 million) for the use of their patents until 2029, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had to cover a 0.8 percent royalty on every immersion machine sold. It was a fraction of the percentage Nikon originally demanded.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In retrospect, Nikon overestimated its own position. When you put smart engineers in two companies that develop the same product, the same ideas can easily emerge. Many of the patents Nikon gathered were granted too effortlessly by the European patent office, but it was undeniably the psychological blow of the camera patents that secured the knockout.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In October 2019, the shell company Tarsium disappeared from the face of the earth. And what came of the ZX1, with its ‘Shoot, Edit, Share’?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A handful of prototypes landed in the hands of reviewers. A few videos and blogs praised the metal lens cap and silent shutter, as well as the included shoulder strap. But they all wondered the same thing: when would the camera finally be available for purchase?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For a brief moment in October 2020, it seemed like it could be ordered from an American online store for a mere 6000 dollars. However, the ZX1 was never actually sold, let alone delivered. When photographers enquired about it, Zeiss’ official response was: ‘We are very critical about the finetuning of all aspects of our camera.’ And that is where it ended. In 2020, Zeiss referred to the ZX1 as a ‘concept camera’. As if it had never existed, as if it had only been built to make Nikon’s life difficult.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But the ZX1 didn’t leave without a trace. Back in his office, Martin van den Brink rummages through his awards and other memorabilia to retrieve a white box. A name is embossed on the front: Zeiss ZX1 – still wrapped in plastic, with the manual untouched. He holds the camera up to his eye and grins.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Brand-new. No idea if it even works – I’ve never taken a photo with it myself.’</p>
