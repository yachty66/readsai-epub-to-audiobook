			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In September 2008, the world came to an abrupt halt. American investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, pulling the emergency brake on the world market and sending it into complete chaos. The banking world had been a house of cards, built, ironically, on real houses with unreliable mortgages. With a global credit crisis now in full swing, there was no capital for chip manufacturers to invest in new technology. The world market shut down, and Veldhoven was left in the cold.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For the most part, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had a knack for anticipating the upcoming peaks and valleys in the chip industry. But no one could have expected this. ‘Never before have we witnessed such a sharp and sudden fall-off in lithography system demand,’ <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> Eric Meurice bluntly stated in his press release on December 18, 2008. It was now <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s turn to hit the brakes. Work ground to a halt in the factories assembling lithography machines. With 6900 permanent employees and a 1600 strong temporary workforce, 1000 jobs needed to go.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> jumped on a reduced working hours program from the Dutch Employee Insurance Agency, <span class="fft-kk">UWV</span>. That program promised to cover 70 percent of the affected workers wages, easing the pressure on companies while allowing them to protect their workforce. 1100 production workers, mainly from the factory floor, had their hours cut. But no one got away unscathed: every employee was also made to forfeit half of their yearly bonus, or their ‘13<sup class="fft-superscript">th</sup>’ month’s pay.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘The Big Down’. This was Peter Wennink’s name for the crisis his company had landed in. But for all the panic surrounding them, Veldhoven was well positioned on 1.3 billion euros in reserves. Compared to their suppliers and chip manufacturers, they were in a remarkably good place. However, as Wennink made clear in a talk with analysts, they didn’t want to be ‘the central bank for the rest of the industry’. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> kept investing, and the shareholders continued to receive dividends.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Dutch politicians soon noticed, and it didn’t make for good news. The chip machine maker was receiving 15 million euros from the government in unemployment funds while paying out 83 million euros to investors. Politicians were astonished: it was basically disguised state support. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> pushed back, arguing that paying dividends helped to prevent stable shareholders from leaving. But the damage was done, and the stock price was cut in half in a matter of months. Now the anxiety kicked in. The last thing they wanted was to become the latest punching bag for a hedge fund or short sellers to speculate on. This would inevitably make it vulnerable to hostile bids, a situation <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was eager to avoid at all costs.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Since it did away with priority shares in 2006, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had left itself with only one line of defense against unwanted takeovers: the preference shares foundation, established in 1998. Fortunately, they never had to call on it, but there was still consistent interest from outside the company. On two occasions, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> could have fallen into American hands. Around 1999, Applied Materials, a manufacturer of etching machines, considered entering the lithography market and canvassed <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to gauge interest in a takeover. Both companies initiated a joint venture in electron lithography in 1999, but it turned out short-lived. Another American chip machine maker, <span class="fft-kk">KLA</span>, wanted to acquire <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> when after the turn of the millennium the share price dropped. Veldhoven rejected the offer, and with that, the discussions ended.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Despite the initial panic, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> pulled through to 2009 without falling into any serious danger. Six months later, the demand for chips and lithography machines began to pick up. They made it. The Netherlands was still fuming about the state aid fiasco, but Eric Meurice refused to give it air. He was already focused on bigger things: expanding the market share of lithography machines for processors and memory chips from 50 to 80 percent. If he managed to pull it off, this would direct most of the money generated for research into new technology straight to Veldhoven’s front door. ‘You’d have to be breathtakingly stupid to screw things up then,’ as a former manager eloquently put it. They were slowly stacking the deck: by continuing to invest in research during a time of crisis while the Japanese competition remained cautious, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was building out a lead.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The company decided to focus on its collaborations with the handful of large chip factories that could afford the increasing investments in new technology. The plug was pulled on niche projects: so died the dream of using lithography machines for the production of LCD screens. The market had potential, but Martin van den Brink wasn’t about to lose good engineers to flatscreens. He needed every available hand to help with the mountain of technical problems <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> was facing. The time left to fulfill Samsung’s demand of 100 watts of power was quickly running out, and another major customer had decided to make life even more difficult.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Still unconvinced that extreme ultraviolet technology worked, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> decided to begin testing an e-beam machine, a piece of tech from the Dutch start-up Mapper. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had long written off e-beam for the mass production of semiconductors. True, if you write the fine chip structures with electrons you no longer need the expensive masks. But the speed of output is far too low for large scale work, and glacial in comparison to what <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> was promising. And this wasn’t about to change: as the fineness of the chip structure increases, the printing only gets slower. Nevertheless, in 2010 <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> came out saying it was convinced that Mapper’s technology was a future standard. Veldhoven thought this was nonsense. They may as well have said grass wasn’t green.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">That same year, Hans Meiling turned into the parking lot at Infinite Loop, the entrance to Apple’s headquarters. It was unusual to visit a ‘customer of a customer’, but Meiling figured the largest tech company in the world was worth an exception. After all, he thought, they invited him. Maybe Apple was considering up starting its own chip factory and wanted to hear about the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>-machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But there was a bigger reason for the visit: the interest of a major customer like Apple could persuade <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>. Meiling did let the Taiwanese know he was heading down to Cupertino. The relationship was fragile as it was – he didn’t need them to find out through the grapevine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A second meeting with Apple soon followed. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s ploy to build trust in the market for <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> technology paid off, and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> ordered their very first <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine soon after. Deeply impressed by the technical leadership of the Taiwanese, Apple dropped Samsung and from January 2013 <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> took over the supply of its mobile devices. It marked the start of a symbiotic relationship between the two tech giants, built on a foundation from Veldhoven.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">There was still one hurdle for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to overcome to get <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> ready for production. The small group working on the light source in San Deigo had been unable to increase the power of the laser. In a call with Martin van den Brink, Cymer’s technical director laid his cards on the table: ‘Look – this <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light is unimaginably more complicated than a regular laser. In the past I used to just wait until everyone else left at five and figure out the problems on my own. But this, this is something else. We can’t crack this.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2012, Van den Brink’s patience finally ran out. He wanted to take over Cymer and gain full control over the light source, hoping more money and more brain power would finally clear the blockage it had created in Europe. But Eric Maurice stubbornly refused. The world according to the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> had a strict natural order: <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is the architect that designs and assembles the systems, suppliers remain suppliers, and acquisitions only cause headaches. At least, that was the gospel according to Eric. He didn’t want to go any further than a non-binding joint venture. For Van den Brink, this didn’t go far enough.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Goddammit Eric, if we don’t take over Cymer we’ll never get there,’ fumed the technical director as they faced off over the idea. But Meurice couldn’t be moved. In search of an ally to help push the takeover through, Martin immediately went to financial director Wennink’s office. Peter blindly trusted Martin’s technical judgement, but he needed some numbers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘On a scale of one to ten, how good is our chance at getting <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> up and running?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Between six and eight,’ replied Van den Brink.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Okay, let’s go.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the next board meeting, the two teamed up and went for the kill. The Frenchman finally conceded: Cymer needed to be acquired. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> couldn’t cover the costs of the takeover and the extra <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>-research on their own, but thankfully, Eric Meurice and Peter Wennink had a plan.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the start of July 2012, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> announced a remarkable deal: the three largest customers were granted a stake in the company to release funds for research. Intel invested 3.3 billion euros into <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in exchange for 15 percent of the shares. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and Samsung followed suit with smaller parts, up to a combined maximum of 25 percent. But they would not be shareholders with voting rights or a chance to vote people on the board of directors. Only one hand gets to steer the course at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The plan was forged over the course of a single brainstorming session in Wennink’s office. He became the driving force behind what became known as the Musketeer project, a reference to the French adventure novel <span class="fft-cursief">The Three Musketeers</span> by Alexandre Dumas. This time, the three protagonists were slightly different. There was Intel, the market leader in processors, Samsung, the largest manufacturer of memory chips, and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, the world’s largest semiconductor foundry. The three companies were united by a shared interest: they were all dependent on the innovation coming from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘One for all and all for one!’ A nice idea, but the chip companies were not that tight-knit. Intel was making plans to use silicon wafers with a diameter of 450 millimeters instead of 300, a larger standard that could fit more chips. But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, like most chip machine manufacturers, had no faith in this format. All the devices in the chip factory would need to be adapted, and this disruption would cost more than the extra yield could ever make up for. The numbers were all wrong. If Intel wanted a ‘450’ lithography machine, the Americans needed to pay for it. Even then, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would only deliver these machines if at least one other manufacturer was on board – this is why they also asked Samsung and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> to acquire a stake. The companies agreed on the condition that a sizable portion of the money would be allocated to <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. The research funds were split: 553 million euros were earmarked for a machine with larger wafers, and 828 million for the development of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> technology.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">During the summer months, the entire <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> leadership traveled the world to unite the musketeers in this collective mission. Intel demanded the most preparation, earning this musketeer its own project name: ‘Polder’. In turn, the Americans came up with a password for the agreement: ‘Stroopwafel’, a sweet treat from the Netherlands. Finally, Intel’s operational director Brian Krzanich signed the papers in a hotel in Palo Alto. Over at <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, the signature of founder Morris Chang was required to purchase 5 percent of Veldhoven’s shares. Samsung acquired a stake at the eleventh hour, taking 3 percent. In all fairness, their <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> had been sick.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In total, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> sold 3.85 billion euros worth of shares, receiving 1.38 billion to invest in the development of new technology. In addition, 1200 high-tech jobs were created in Veldhoven. This was a huge amount for a company with 4000 engineers, and a massive boost for the Brabant region.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, the plan still needed to be approved at the shareholders meeting. While minority stakes from clients are not unusual in the chip industry, what <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was about to present would be a tougher pill to swallow. In exchange for compensation, existing investors were being asked to contribute a portion of their stake. A synthetic buyback of shares: a clever construction devised by Wennink to avoid diluting the value.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A barrage of critical questions followed from major investors such as Capital Group, Fidelity and BlackRock. Wennink weathered the storm, and in September 2012 the shareholders finally agreed. A month later, they announced the acquisition of Cymer for 1.95 billion dollars in shares.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, the deal would take an unexpected turn for the freshly ordained shareholder Intel. As promised, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> worked on the ‘450’ machine for a year. But Van den Brink was done playing games. If Intel wanted it, they needed to place an order and pay for it. The Americans were reluctant and felt they had been called out. ‘Are there no other manufacturers who would like to buy a ‘450’ machine?’ ‘Well, geez, this was <span class="fft-cursief">your</span> idea,’ sneered Van den Brink.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In early 2013, Van den Brink arranged a meeting in California between the technical directors of Intel, Samsung and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>. For the first time, the three musketeers could look each other in the eye. It was no longer one for all, but two against one. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and Samsung went straight for the jugular: they saw no sense in the larger wafers. This surprise attack knocked Intel’s boss off his feet. After decades of American hegemony, Asian chip manufacturers were now the ones calling the shots. And there was nothing he could do about it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The 450 project was brought to an abrupt halt and the remaining budget freed up, giving <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> an extra 300 million euros to get <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> up to speed. That money came in at exactly the right time.</p>
