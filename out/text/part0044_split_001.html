			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The image of the man with the horned head dress was etched into everyone’s mind the moment it flashed across the world’s screens. On Wednesday January 6, 2021, Jacob Chansley, a.k.a the QAnon Shaman, stormed the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Capitol along with a group of rioters after refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential elections. Donald Trump had lost, and the violent rampage that followed left deep scars on the democratic heart of the United States. But despite their deteriorated relationship, both Republicans and Democrats still agreed on one thing: ever-advancing China was public enemy number one. Trump had discovered that he could use export regulations to constrain Chinese tech companies, and his Democratic successor, Joe Biden, set his sights on perfecting that weapon. After his arrival, the Americans decided they would no longer settle for the export ban on <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines. The White House wanted to grasp the Chinese chip industry by the throat, and forcing <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to make further concessions would be the best way to do it.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Who in Washington writes the rules of the technology war? After passing through the security gates at Lafayette Square, do not take a left towards the White House. Take a right instead, past the West Wing where the president addresses the press, and go up the stairs of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. This five-story structure of immovable granite – in French Second Empire style, as they call it – is home to the executive branch of the United States.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When the Executive Office Building was erected in 1888, the so-called Department of War moved in. That memory is kept alive by signs outside each office commemorating the government officials that worked within them. The halls are lined with a pattern of black and white tiles, repeating like an endless chessboard. Even when you whisper, you hear an echo.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This building houses the advisory bodies of the American president. The most influential entity is the National Security Council, which advises Biden on national security and foreign policy. The <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> has the most beautiful of all the offices, located on the second floor.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Trump administration spelled chaos for the National Security Council: key figures abruptly departed, and a large amount of people were dismissed. Under the Biden administration, however, the staff expanded to more than 350 people, all united in orchestrating the plan to halt China’s advance and boost the American chip industry with billions in state aid. The <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> also ensured that the relevant departments adhered to the established strategy. Geopolitics demands discipline, not a cackling henhouse.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Even before he was sworn in, Joe Biden pulled out all the diplomatic stops to coordinate export restrictions with allies. America started playing chess on several boards at once. In the Trade and Technology Council (<span class="fft-kk">TTC</span>), a strategic dialogue between the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> and the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, discussions included export restrictions and stimulus plans for the domestic chip industry. Europe, like America, was developing a plan to support the local chip industry with tens of billions in subsidies. It was essentially a pot of gold to entice manufacturers to expand their production outside of Asia.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The United States were also trying to establish a ‘Chip 4 alliance’ with Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. However, Japan and South Korea share a complex history of war and territorial disputes, and trying to align these countries proved to be a challenge.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The closed trilateral discussions between America, Japan and the Netherlands, known as ‘trilats’, were particularly important for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. As the three countries responsible for supplying the machines and software essential to chip manufacturing, the trilats aimed to maximize Western technological superiority by depriving China of the tools it needs to build advanced chips. Following their success with the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> case, the <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> turned its focus to another one of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s innovations – their advanced immersion systems. These systems make use of deep ultraviolet light, a field the company holds a 90 percent market share in. The chips made by these machines might not be as advanced as <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>, but they are still good enough to produce powerful processors for complex computing tasks – if you use the right multi-patterning techniques.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Netherlands had known for a while that the Americans wanted to discuss export restrictions for these systems. In December 2020, Robert O’Brien, the last of Trump’s four national security advisers, met with his Dutch counterpart Geoffrey van Leeuwen. In the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> ambassador’s Paris residence, O’Brien raised the topic of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s deliveries to China. Van Leeuwen figured the issue was a sidenote in a broader discussion about technical leadership.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Anyone who followed the influential think tanks in Washington, <span class="fft-kk">DC</span> could have known that stricter measures were on the horizon. Biden’s National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, was devising a strategy based on preparatory work done by two <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> members, Tarun Chhabra and Saif Khan. Before they began working in the stately Eisenhower Building, they had each published extensive reports for think tanks such as Brookings and <span class="fft-kk">CSET</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Washington is home to hundreds of these non-profit advisory institutions, which function as a source of information for the current administration and a talent pool for government employees. The highest officials of each department in the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> are politically appointed, and both Republicans and Democrats have their own pools of specialists to draw from. Such networks tend to encourage a ‘revolving door’ style of politics, but the think-tankers prefer to characterize it as a symbiosis of policy and new insights. Whatever your angle, it is the engine that keeps <span class="fft-kk">DC</span> running.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2019, Tarun Chhabra published the article ‘The China Challenge, Democracy, and<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Grand Strategy’, in which he described how the ‘democratic capitalism’ of America and its allies was threatened by the ‘authoritarian capitalism’ of China. According to Chhabra, China’s goal was simple: create economic dependencies, and then exploit them. China’s alignment with Russia had created a hostile power bloc in Eurasia, which posed ‘unacceptable risks’ to the prosperity and security of the United States.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In March 2021, Saif Khan published a study on China’s dependence on chip machines from Western countries. The report stated that China trailed far behind in the race but was attempting to take the inside lane: the country had allegedly been stealing technology, as well as using foreign investments and returning knowledge workers to accelerate the development of its own chip machines. Khan concluded that having access to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s advanced lithography systems was China’s main bottleneck. But for the Chinese to truly feel the pressure, the Dutch government would need to play along. In fact, it would need a whole new playing field.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As mentioned, the Netherlands regulates export licenses based on the dual-use list of the Wassenaar Arrangement. The <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> machines were removed from that list in 2014 because a new technology had become available: extreme ultraviolet. In 2019 and 2020, the United States tried to use the Wassenaar Arrangement to again regulate <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span>. The Netherlands, with both Belgium and Germany in tow, put their foot down. Veldhoven and The Hague agreed that, with the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> restriction for China in place, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had already compromised enough.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But this was not enough to satisfy the Americans. If China could not be slowed via Wassenaar, then allies like the Netherlands and Japan would have to impose export restrictions on their own chip machine makers and their <span class="fft-kk">DUV </span>scanners. Otherwise, the Americans would sort it out the American way – with unilateral measures.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Since Biden’s inauguration in early 2021, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> had been in talks with each of these countries about what these restrictions could look like. The key question: who will do what, and when?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The trilaterals started as a slow diplomatic dance, as an American negotiator who conducted the initial talks on behalf of the Biden administration explained. ‘We first had to demonstrate how committed the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> were by imposing restrictions on our own industry. Only then would we be able to open discussions with Japan and the Netherlands in good faith.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> initially tried to prevent the Netherlands from taking part in the trilaterals. Veldhoven did not think it wise for a ‘Mickey Mouse country’ – as Peter Wennink described it – to get caught between the major powers. On the other hand, Wennink figured, it was better to have a seat at the table to avoid the Americans from enforcing their rules without consultation.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Dutch government was open to imposing some restrictions on the export of immersion scanners to China from a national security perspective. However, it would do so only on the condition that all three relevant countries took the measures simultaneously, and that all steps would be taken to ensure the existing chip shortage would not worsen. Anything resembling a blockade or ‘decoupling’ was also considered too extreme. After all, China is the world’s largest supplier of rare earth metals, which are indispensable for the energy transition and for the chip industry. And unlike America, a ‘Mickey Mouse’ country like the Netherlands does not have the natural resources to start mining its own.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Dutch naïveté towards China has passed, albeit more recently than they’d care to admit. In 2018, Prime Minister Mark Rutte travelled to China with a large Dutch trade delegation and presented an award to Huawei as a token of appreciation for the company’s large investments in the Netherlands. A year later, Rutte was bristling at the thought of the superpower becoming technologically dominant. The Netherlands was now on the same page as the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, and was edging increasingly closer towards Washington.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">There was another strategic reason to be concerned about the rise of China. Should the country grow unchecked and further consolidate its capacity for chip production, it could become less dependent on Taiwanese factories like <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>. This would then lower the threshold for claiming Taiwan, even before the Chinese People’s Republic would celebrate its one hundredth anniversary. This scenario could cause the whole world to have a problem, but less so for China itself.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Blindly trusting the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> was considered just as naïve as depending on China, however. As the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs warned, the Americans were also using national security to drive trade policy and protect the position of their own chip companies. To defend the interests of businesses and trade the ministry demanded a seat at the negotiating table. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is a key driver of the Dutch economy – they were not going to let the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> limit that growth engine without a fight.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the same time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs had also become more vigilant regarding China’s ambitions, and the warnings from the security services led to increased government intervention in the business sector. For instance, the ministry was quick to take a stake in Eindhoven-based chip start-up Smart Photonics in 2020, which prevented a Chinese investment fund from gaining access to its high-tech knowledge. The Netherlands had finally realized that it needed to start protecting its open economy.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The line between the Binnenhof – the seat of government in The Hague – and the White House was short. Since the United Kingdom left the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span>, the Netherlands became the closest transatlantic ally and best friend to the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. National security advisors Jake Sullivan and Geoffrey van Leeuwen updated each other every two months via an encrypted line, WhatsApp or Signal. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was often the topic of discussion, but with Russian aggression increasing and China seemingly transforming into a totalitarian state, it was not always at the top of their agenda. Both security advisors agreed that the technological superiority of the West needed to be maintained. But how?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The American proposed the first step: China should not be allowed to acquire the domestic capability to manufacture processors finer than 14 nanometers. For memory chips, a different set of standards would apply.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To estimate the consequences of these measures, the Dutch negotiators relied heavily on information provided to them by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. They trusted that the company with feelers across the entire global chip industry had the better overview. As a ‘victim’ of the export measures, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> collaborated to prevent the situation from deteriorating any further. In Veldhoven, Peter Wennink personally provided Van Leeuwen with an intensive crash course on chip technology to help him get to grips with the subject. The chip industry had always been a perfectly optimized value chain, and it horrified Wennink to think of people pushing and pulling without understanding how it all worked.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Many of the technological discussions were held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, right next to the central train station in The Hague, or at the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> embassy in Wassenaar, close to the castle where the Wassenaar Arrangement had been drafted. Experts from both countries would gather in a room on the second floor overlooking the embassy courtyard. The table, made of white frosted glass, had room for ten people, and others could join the conversations via a secure video connection on a large screen. The only decorations on the wall were a whiteboard, a clock and a map of the Netherlands – all the tools you need for slowing down China’s semiconductor industry.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Sometimes there were dual sessions: one meeting at which state secrets could be discussed, and another including specialists from two Dutch tech companies. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was one of them, and alongside it was a familiar face: <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International, the company that laid the foundation for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> with Philips in 1984. Their advanced deposition machines granted them a seat at the table.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Americans strived to not only halt, but even reverse the technological advancement of the Chinese chip industry. However, this message coincided with a severe shortage of all types of chips, including the less advanced or ‘mature’ processors that China produced en masse, and it was poorly received. This lack was partly due to the <span class="fft-kk">COVID</span>-19 pandemic: in 2021, remote workers required a volume of computing power and cloud capacity that outweighed what the chip industry could supply.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The shortage had already forced French and German car manufacturers to pause their production lines, and they feared even more shortages would follow if the Chinese companies faced further restrictions. The Dutch delegation kept France and Germany in the know about the negotiations, but, much to the frustration of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, that was the extent of the European involvement. The company lobbied to turn the trilaterals into an <span class="fft-kk">EU</span>-wide discussion, which would allow Germany and France to also exert their influence. A unified European stance would be a stronghold against China and the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. But in the end, the Netherlands were on their own. In Veldhoven, they drew a different conclusion. It seemed the Dutch negotiators overestimated their clout compared to the Americans. The Dutch may be tall, but this time they had imagined themselves bigger than they actually were.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Over in Washington, the <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> exercised strict control over the Entity List of the Bureau of Industry and Security. Following that, dozens of Chinese companies with military connections were added to the list. Many license applications had been given the green light under Trump: in the eyes of the National Security Council, he was far too lenient towards the industry. The <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> wanted to keep a firm grip on export regulations with a ‘top-down policy’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The expansion of the Entity List led to significant tensions when <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> required an American license for a substantial order from the Chinese chip manufacturer <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>. Some spare parts of the scanner were being produced in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, such as the deep ultra-violet light sources made by the subsidiary Cymer in San Diego or the modules from the division in Connecticut. Even if they were sent to China via the Netherlands, they would still fall under American regulations. The long arm of Washington had a reach that even Veldhoven could not escape.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> Peter Wennink, it was a reason to strengthen ties with the new administration in Washington. He reached out to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, whom he met in June of 2021 during the G7 summit in Brussels. Due to the pandemic, it was not until October of that year that he was able to visit Washington himself. In consultation with Dutch diplomats, Wennink squeezed twelve meetings into a handful of days, starting with a visit to the trade association of the American automative industry to discuss the chip shortage. The car lobby is powerful, and he figured it could help to convince politicians not to put the brakes on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> too much.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In Washington, Wennink zoomed back and forth on the Capitol’s subway linking the government buildings between discussions with politicians, meetings with representatives from the Bureau of Industry and Security and the Pentagon, and dinners with the National Security Council. Everyone cleared their agendas for ‘that Dutch company’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Once again, Wennink proved himself to be <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s most important in-house ambassador. He felt like a fish in water among the dignitaries and gathered his staff in his hotel in Washington to practice conversations with the Americans. The team members would present the critical questions, and he would line up the arguments and build his case piece by piece, as if he were decorating a Christmas tree. Wennink adheres to the harmony model of resolving issues. Making connections is second nature to him: he knows the power of a quick nod, a look or a personal comment to put someone at ease.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> tried to avoid ideological discussions, but that was not always possible. During a dinner with American diplomats, he was asked about the chip industry’s role in relation to the Uyghurs in China. This Muslim minority is oppressed by the Chinese state and is being monitored with advanced electronics. ‘As the chip industry, we’re not responsible for that. We don’t arrest people,’ Wennink answered. When he bounced the ball back and asked about American school shootings and what responsibilities gun manufacturers might have, an awkward silence followed. Who was he to patronize the US?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink prefers to throw in a lot of facts – an hour-long meeting usually consists of forty-five minutes listening to him detailing specifics. He is a natural teacher, especially when explains the mutual dependencies in the chip world. He repeatedly warned American politicians that putting the squeeze on China would have consequences for their cars and washing machines, and that it would take years for new chip factories to start production. He showed them the numbers:<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> firms receive the lion’s share of chip industry profits, and any money they make in China could be invested into boosting their technological lead. ‘Where’s your self-confidence!’ he would often say.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As one member of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s supervisory board pointed out, Peter was so well-versed in the subject, he would often present his solutions as if they were ‘ready-to-use products’, leaving little or nothing to argue about. Wennink tried to steer away from being rash and to suppress his own opinion – the storytelling had to be ‘sophisticated’ and weave a refined narrative.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But Wennink would not always hold back. He once interrupted a senator who had been discussing the threats posed by China for a solid ten minutes with a blunt ‘You don’t know all the facts.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Those were the occasions when the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> had been too direct, he later heard from Dutch diplomats. The Americans would easily get annoyed by his ‘mark my words’ attitude and the frequent sight of his index finger raised in warning. However, by the end of 2021, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had secured the necessary export license for <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Meanwhile, the Americans were growing impatient over the slow progress of the trilats. The Dutch negotiators were taking their time to shine a light on every detail of the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> proposals. But in February 2022, it became clear that the Netherlands could be decisive if needed. When Russia invaded Ukraine, European countries immediately struck back with a heavy sanctions package. The <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> showed that it was prepared to hit its own economy if necessary. National security became palpable – one look at their energy bills was enough for most Europeans to notice this.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Americans were positively surprised by the decisiveness of the Dutch, which also extended to their supply of weapons to Ukraine. The start of a war on European soil had emphasized the strategic importance of technological superiority, and a new generation was exposed to the reality of what this meant. ‘Everyday’ Dutch chips ended up in the killer drones fired at Ukrainian cities, while advanced chips were used to help Ukraine’s air defenses, data collection via satellites and the coordination of missile attacks far behind enemy lines. The stakes look different in the cold light of war.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It took another crisis for the negotiations between the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, the Netherlands and Japan to finally pick up speed. In August 2022, Taiwan was visited by the Speaker of the American House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> feared that China had been inspired by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and that it was preparing to invade Taiwan. In turn, the Chinese were furious that America was treating their ‘renegade province’ as a separate country by making these symbolic trips.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Taiwanese population has been living at odds with the mainland for seventy years, and many are so accustomed to the Chinese military threat that it is simply part of daily life. In the eyes of some Taiwanese, Pelosi’s visit disturbed the delicate cross-strait status quo. However, the majority still embrace<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> support: they don’t want to be dragged closer to China, especially after witnessing Xi Jingping dismantle the democratic movement in Hong Kong with a strict security law.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The economic ties between China and Taiwan are strong. The democratic and free-spirited Taiwan – the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage – cannot function without trade from China. In 2022, it accounted for more than 40 percent of Taiwan’s gross national product – that is more than three times higher than their trade with the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">China responded to Pelosi’s visit with large-scale military exercises that indicated a possible blockade of the island. Such an obstruction would be disastrous for the company and the global economy. For almost two years, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> had been trying to forge a joint techfront to take the wind out of China’s sails. But with the Chinese warships circling Taiwan, they knew they needed to take the first step.</p>
