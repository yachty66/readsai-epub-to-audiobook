			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Despite the collapse of the joint venture with <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> lived on through a combination of fortuitous circumstances. First was the timing; in 1985 there was a dip in the chip industry, hitting established chip machine manufacturers hard. However, the young company had little to lose and powered on with production. They trusted the market would pick up, and wanted to be two steps ahead of the rest when it did.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In addition, they emerged well from the first venture with <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International. Del Prado’s inexperience with lithography came at the cost of his relationship to Smit and his share in the company. But for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, it proved an advantage. They were not forced to mold themselves on already successful companies, leaving the young start-up with space to develop their own culture and strategy in these formative years. An American lithography company would never have tolerated that amount of freedom.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The partnership with Philips also came to their rescue. During the chip market’s heaviest downturn, the electronic group’s financial muscle was able to keep <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> afloat, ordering new lithography systems and even opening doors to new customers in Taiwan. They also got help from another player – the Dutch government. The founding of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> coincided with a reassessment of government policy when it came to their relationship with industry. The success of Japanese chip manufacturers had hit the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and European sectors hard in the early ’80s, and a large part of the reason companies like NEC, Hitachi and Toshiba were able to take such a lead was due to the scale of the investment by the Japanese government in their research projects. Other countries took note, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> found themselves on the crest of a new wave of strategic public investment.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs was tired of keeping languishing industries afloat. The struggling shipyards were dropped, and they turned their focus to supporting innovation. It was clear microchips were the future, and with NatLab’s wafer stepper they had been gifted the key. They needed it to succeed, so the ministry invested over 100 million guilders for research and development. Steef Wittekoek and Frits van Hout pushed for more, working around the clock to bring in new subsidies. In these initial years, about half of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s money for research came from The Hague or Brussels.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This was not the only large government project that played into <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s hands. In 1984, Philips teamed up with a German partner Siemens in an effort to make the next leap in chip technology. With a name that seemed like it could be lifted straight from an old monster movie, the ‘Mega’ Project aimed to take on the Japanese by entering right at the top of the market for memory chips. The plan gained support from the highest levels, with the European technology project ESPRIT and both the Dutch and German governments contributing vast amounts of money. In today’s terms, the latter two put forward roughly half a billion euros combined. With this, Philips plunged into the production of static random-access memory (SRAM) chips. These could store data without the need for their own power source, and with the help of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> Philips built an entire test line for these chips. But the initial production was a loss; there was not enough demand for the chips and Siemens walked away from the project, opting instead for an already established Japanese chip technology. This spelled the end of the monstrous Mega Project, and with it the dreams of a European technological resurgence.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Despite racking up a tab of hundreds of millions of guilders, the Mega Project turned out not to be a waste of money for Philips. In 1987, the company was contacted by Morris Chang, former technical director of the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> company Texas Instruments. Raised in China and educated in America, Chang was an expert in increasing the yield, the percentage of faultless chips on a wafer. The Taiwanese government noticed and tapped him to be the lead in establishing a national chip industry, promising to cover any and all costs. This marked the start of the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or as it is widely known today, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>. Chang sought another large, experienced investor from the sector. But the Japanese were not interested, plus talks with Intel and Texas Instruments fell through. So he turned to Philips, in his eyes the cream of the second-rate chipmakers. Hardly a compliment, but what mattered was getting the collaboration – and Philips was the next best thing.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Philips happily agreed, taking a 28 percent stake in <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and sharing the expertise cultivated from the Mega Project. But the partnership also opened the door for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to get their machines onto <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s factory floors. Chang held fire. He needed to be convinced of the quality of the equipment. While on holiday with his wife in Bali, Wim Troost received a polite tap on his shoulder. ‘Mr. Troost, a call for you.’ He wormed out of his cross-legged position in the middle of a dance performance and snuck out of the audience to take the call. It was Veldhoven: the deal with <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> had come through. It turned out there was a way to win Chang over. Troost had given away the first machine to <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> for free on a no cure, no pay basis. The highly demanding Taiwanese were convinced.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With the partnership between <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in full swing, the Taiwanese chip industry proceeded to boom. The two companies turned out to be surprisingly likeminded. Both functioned in an equally speedy and chaotic manner, with each totally dependent on the other to churn out endless piles of wafers every hour, free of faulty chips. ‘We have their backs and they have ours,’ was the mantra of the <span class="fft-kk">ASML’</span>ers. This one sentence became the formula for dominating the chip market.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">All the while, Philips was slowly reducing its stake in <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, earning billions in the process. In 2006 it pulled out of the semiconductor market altogether, divesting its chip division <span class="fft-kk">NXP</span>. Now left to its own devices, <span class="fft-kk">NXP</span> went on to become a major supplier to the automotive industry. How valuable the now-decimated Philips could have been if it had held on to these shares, or to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, is a question that still haunts the Dutch to this day. In truth, Philips likely would have collapsed at an early stage.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Philips laid the technical foundation for <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, and it was thanks to orders from Taiwan that kept <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> afloat in the early days. ‘Without them,’ says Frits van Hout, ‘we would have certainly gone under.’ Their luck was further bolstered in 1988 when the initial order from <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> received an unexpected sequel. A fire had torn through the Taiwanese chip factory, causing serious damage to dozens of machines. The news reached <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>: they were to deliver another shipment immediately, all at the expense of the insurance company.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the years that followed under Morris Chang’s leadership, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> would grow into the world’s most advanced chip manufacturer. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> was a foundry, focused on producing designs from other tech companies instead of their own. The model proved a success. As the whole process of chip production was growing increasingly complex and costly, the process of making these wafers was being outsourced by more and more chipmakers. The chips hit the market quicker, and at a far lower price than it would be if production was kept in-house. In the end, most let go of their own factories and became ‘fabless’. These changes played straight into <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s hands. Through their close collaboration with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, they then were able to push through new technology at breakneck speed, expanding their capacity and turning Taiwan into the world’s supplier of advanced computing power.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Intel could only watch from the sidelines, having let slip the chance to team up with Morris Chang in 1987. Thirty years on, Intel could not keep up the pace with <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> anymore. As Joe Biden would later declare in his State of the Union address, America had lost its edge.</p>
