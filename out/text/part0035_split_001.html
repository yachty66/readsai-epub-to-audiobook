			<p class="ff-platmetwit">NanoCity. Sounds small, but 40 percent of the world’s digital memory is born here. When you exit from highway 311 towards Samsung’s memory chip factories in Hwaseong, it’s hard to imagine that South Korea was once incredibly poor. Exhausted by Japanese colonization and ravaged by the Korean war, for a time it was even worse off than its sibling to the North. But since 1970, the GDP per Korean has grown from 600 to 40,000 dollars. Thanks to the strictly planned economy of the military dictatorship and mega-corporations like Samsung, LG and Hyundai, the country transformed into an industrial powerhouse. 20 percent of the South Korean economy now relies on the revenue of one single company. Hence their nickname: this is the Republic of Samsung.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The colossal fabs are covered with a series of red, yellow and blue panels, each several meters high. It evokes the colors of the iconic Dutch painter Piet Mondriaan – but, as a Samsung employee points out, this isn’t art. It’s an enlarged rendering of the patterns found on the memory chips, for the storage capacity of your phone or the working memory of your laptop, that are produced in these buildings.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Upon entering the Samsung factory, you are greeted by a plaque inscribed with ten guiding principles for its employees. ‘Reach beyond your goal’ is one of the commandments. Founder Lee Byung-chull admired the wisdom of the Chinese philosopher Confucius and was inspired by the rock-solid discipline of Japanese factories. Under his successor Lee Kun-hee, Samsung’s shifted its focus towards the West and became the market leader in telephones. Kun-hee believed that Korea’s biggest conglomerate needed to swiftly adapt to new markets, touting his favorite slogan: ‘Change everything, except for your wife and children.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">NanoCity, situated just south of the capital Seoul, has a fully operational production line open for visitors. ‘This one is as big as three soccer fields, but we also have ones spanning the size of eleven,’ the guide explains, gesturing towards the cleanroom behind her. Shielded off by a large glass wall, visitors have a panoramic view over the entire space. There is little to see except machines. Humans pose too much of a risk: they bring in dirt and dust particles that harm production. Nevertheless, an invisible team of thirty employees is on standby, ready to intervene should any issues arise.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Robots and automated carts transport stacks of wafers, each containing up to ten thousand memory chips. It takes six weeks for one disc to undergo every step of the process, after which it goes to a different factory to be cut up into individual chips.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Chip machine manufacturers like Applied Materials, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> have branches located nearby Samsung so they can promptly respond when called upon. The guide points to the back of the hall where the scanners are located, bathed in a sea of yellow light. ‘The color aids the lithography process, just like developing photos in a darkroom.’ A golden halo for the factory’s most expensive piece of equipment.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The chip division is the most lucrative arm of Samsung Electronics. But demand for memory chips fluctuates heavily, leading to dips in the market that hit Samsung’s revenue hard. In addition, computer memory chips have a slimmer profit margin compared to advanced computing processors, which is why the Koreans are so intensely focused on efficiency and high throughput. Once they get <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> up and running, and the machine spends less time idle, they stand to save valuable production time.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the end of 2018, NanoCity was filled with large yellow construction cranes as work began on a new eight-story factory. The start-up cost: 15 billion dollars, with an additional injection of 11 billion dollars. Samsung was effectively building two fabs on top of one another, as it also wanted to use the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines for making memory chips. White and blue containers with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s logo were already piled up, ready to go.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Through tireless effort and military-style discipline, Samsung and<span class="fft-kk"> SK </span>Hynix, formerly part of Hyundai, conquered the chip world. And they expect nothing less from their suppliers. Working in South Korea means, ‘pushing hard, harder, and then even harder’, in the words of one <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’er.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s sales director Sunny Stalnaker was born in Korea and deals extensively with Korean technicians. She is quick to answer when asked what sets these chip factories apart from other customers: ‘Simple. Their laser-sharp focus.’ The Koreans are fixated on getting the most of out of their lithography machines, and do not tolerate setbacks.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When the Asian currency crisis hit in 1997, it plunged Samsung and<span class="fft-kk"> SK </span>Hynix deeply into debt. It required billions of dollars in support from the International Monetary Fund to help the South Korean economy recover. According to Stalnaker, the chip factories survived on sheer willpower: ‘All Asian chipmakers pay attention to costs, but none of them push like the Koreans – they work unbelievably hard.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For instance, as soon as there is a problem with a system, the Samsung employees in charge stay onsite until the machine is up and running again. ‘They don’t even think about going home before a problem is solved. If you asked them, they’d probably just laugh.’ You can see this dedication has rubbed off on the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers in South Korea: the office comes complete with beds, so you can take a power nap in between speaking to enthusiastic chip manufacturers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘A sharp knife calls for a good cook,’ or so the saying goes at Samsung. They aim for nothing less than total mastery over the recipes for producing chips with lithography, the employees at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> have noticed. ‘When there’s a problem with a machine, you get bombarded with their analyses, down to the smallest detail,’ says Stalnaker. ‘They’re not necessarily relevant, but you need to run through it all to get a grasp on all the facts. And in the meantime, you have to answer ten thousand questions. They want updates every hour, even if nothing happens in that hour.’ In the early nineties, Japanese lithography makers often covered up their machines during maintenance, to prevent Korean customers from seeing the internal components. <span class="fft-kk">ASML,</span> on the other hand, laid everything bare for all to see.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Koreans have a ‘killer mentality,’ as Frits van Hout says. In his years leading <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s support department, he frequently found himself alone face-to-face with of a group of shouting Koreans. However, there was no point trying to match their tone. ‘They’re all under enormous pressure from their bosses. And as soon as you find the solution to their problem, you have a friend for life.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As a token of gratitude and on behalf of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, Van Hout was presented with South Korea’s Hendrick Hamel award. Hamel is probably the most famous Dutchman you’ve never heard of. Back in the seventeenth century, the life of this bookkeeper from Gorinchem took an unexpected turn when, while working for the Dutch East India Company, a shipwreck accidently landed him in Korea. His travelogue opened the doors for foreign trade, and he has been celebrated as a folk hero in Korea ever since. He’s almost as popular as Guus Hiddink, the soccer coach who led the South Korean national team to great success. More than three hundred years later, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is still enjoying the fruits of Hendrick Hamel’s adventure. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2023, Dutch exports to South Korean totaled 12 billion euros, with ‘specialized machines’ contributing 6.3 billion euros. And the bulk of these machines came from Veldhoven.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin van den Brink remembers the aggressive atmosphere in Korea during the years that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> first supplied Samsung: ‘A lot of suppliers were used to bending to Samsung’s will, but we were still too small to meet all their demands.’ In the nineties, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> outsourced maintenance in Korean chip factories to local intermediaries to bridge the cultural gap. When it set up its own service organization, it looked to primarily hire Korean workers, as they were used to the strict hierarchy and long workweeks of fifty hours or more. The high level of education in South Korea proved to be another advantage, with relatively large numbers of women pursuing technological studies. And even at school, the pressure to perform at your best is extremely high. According to Sunny Stalnaker, that’s just part of Asian culture: ‘Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Japan: in all these countries children are up until midnight, studying.’</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span> managed to get the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light source for Samsung up to standard, albeit seven years later than agreed. Almost simultaneously, their Taiwanese competitor <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> started with the production of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> chips. However, only one could be first, so the Brabanders needed to come up with a trick to allow each of them a spot in the limelight. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> became the first with a machine that could expose more than 150 <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> wafers per hour, and Samsung secured bragging rights over the most powerful light source. By this point, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was already on the verge of surpassing the 250-watt limit.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For a while, the Far East were the only guests at the party when it came to producing chips using extreme ultraviolet light. In 2018, American chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries pulled the plug on two <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines in Malta, New York after they failed to achieve an economically viable level of production. Intel was being surpassed by their competitors in Asia on every front and would only start using <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> for chips after 2023.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">American politicians are inclined to perceive chip technology as something that was snatched from them by Asia, just as ‘their’ extreme ultraviolet light source was taken over by a Dutch company. Van den Brink sees it differently: ‘The development of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> has been going on for 25 years. They did the first five years, but we’ve done the last twenty.’ Put simply, the Asian chip manufacturers took the lead thanks to their willingness to take greater risks than the American competition.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In August 2019, the first smartphone with an <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>-produced processor hit the shelves: the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, based on 7-nanometer technology. Martin van den Brink received a device as a gift – a small thanks from the same boss who often drove him to despair. At the end of 2019, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> delivered a comparable chip for the Chinese company Huawei’s phones. Apple soon followed , and in 2020 an <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>-chip made with <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s 5-nanometer technology was installed in the iPhone.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The descriptions that chip manufacturers use for these technological generations or ‘nodes’ need to be taken with a grain of salt. The physical dimensions of the smallest circuits and connections on the chip are, in practice, five to ten times larger than advertised. A nanometer was once just a nanometer, but accuracy has never stopped a good marketing slogan.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Neither does ‘<span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> chip’ tell the whole story. Every processor is built in dozens of layers: if you cut a chip in half, you’ll uncover all sorts of different lithography techniques stacked on one another, just like the rings in a tree trunk. Only a handful of the layers with the most critical circuits are exposed using <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. For the patterns of the other layers, conventional machines do the job.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In December 2020 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> celebrated the sale of their one hundredth <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> scanner, but the technology was still far from being mature. The machines in the factories required drastic upgrades and fixes: whenever the laser was taken out for repairs, the whole operation would stand still for weeks, or even months. This meant a large number of back-up machines needed to be on standby at all times.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Chip manufacturers are also keen to exaggerate problems with the machines. They cannot replace a multi-million-dollar scanner for a competitor’s version at the first sign of trouble, so instead they prefer to keep <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> on its toes by emphasizing the setbacks and presenting long lists of complaints. The engineers are bombarded with PowerPoint presentations containing hundreds of slides – one for each missing screw and each delayed spare part.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But by far the most noise is made over contaminating particles that cause deviations on the silicon wafer. Issues here are quickly passed on to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> specialists who can help optimize production. It is a stressful job, according to one of the employees in Asia. You’re meeting customers during the day, conferring with the designers in Veldhoven in the evening, and taking video calls from San Diego in the early morning. It feels like a non-stop meeting that leaves you with at best five hours of sleep per night. ‘Unless an unexpected problem arises. Then it’s even less.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The mirror, which collects the light from the exploding tin droplets, requires regular cleaning. Initially, this task needs to be done every few weeks, eventually extending to every few months. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> developed a carwash-like system, equipped with a high-pressure cleaner specifically designed for the collectors. With so many <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines already running in Asia, it is far more convenient to run this process in that region, rather than constantly having to fly the mirrors back and forward to the Netherlands to be cleaned.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This is why Linkou, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s Taiwan branch, cleans more than two hundred <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> collectors each year. Even the dirty mirrors from South Korea are sent to Taiwan, where they end up in Cathy’s cleanroom cabin. She’s just graduated as a mechanical engineer and is busy working on a new subject: a mirror with caked on blobs of tin, as if a sloppy painter had been messing around with putty. Cathy sets the timer: twelve hours of cleaning with <span class="fft-kk">CO</span><sub class="fft-subscript">2</sub>, and the mirror is ready to go back into a machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The majority of mirrors find their way back into a scanner owned by the largest customer, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>. After all, Korea may provide the digital memory, but the world runs on the computing power from Taiwan.</p>
