			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Now partly seceded from Philips, in 1985 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> started the construction of its own head office. The new building rose beside the highway in Veldhoven in less than a year, complete with the dust-free cleanrooms needed to manufacture their machines. The municipality had been quick to say yes to the high-tech player, eager for the additional employment it brought to the area. However, the neighboring municipalities of Eindhoven and Son were less pleased. Veldhoven hadn’t acquired the necessary permits, and they lodged a complaint with the courts. But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> couldn’t afford to wait, and they pushed ahead with construction.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The first headquarters exuded Gjalt Smit’s ambition. Inspired by the futurism of Silicon Valley to help their American customers feel at home, the 30-million-guilder statement boasted of a budget that far outweighed the age of the company. Although employees did not yet have to wear face masks, there was mandatory special clothing to keep the workspaces clean. An easy way to display their seriousness; during the early years at Philips, you could still enter in your own dust coat.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers, as they tend to be called, are not ones for fuss. The first building was simply named ‘Building 1’, and ‘Building 2’ followed soon after. It isn’t hard to guess what they called the third. Everything was clearly numbered, like a takeout menu from an Asian restaurant. There was also no logo on the façade, at the request of architect Rob van Aken. His design said it all; you knew you were about to enter the headquarters of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Building 1 has since been demolished, but back in 1985 it was an unusual sight. It looked like a portal to the digital age, stuck in the middle of bucolic Brabant. The sloping white walls, shrouded in blue mirrored glass, gave its pyramid form an air of mystery. At night, local children imagined the building was a <span class="fft-kk">UFO</span>, its strange lights emanating from tech-heads burning the midnight oil. Van Aken used to imagine the triangular shape as a big hat falling over the production areas and offices, symbolically embracing all the departments. However, despite the display of futuristic engineering, a construction fault caused the hat to leak. Sometimes the best tech isn’t necessarily high-tech: when it rained, you would still see a bucket or two in the lobby.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span> immediately wanted to play at the highest level and compete alongside the <span class="fft-kk">USA</span>’s <span class="fft-kk">GCA</span> and Japan’s Nikon, the big hitters of the moment. In the press, Smit exuded self-confidence. ‘In this industry, only one business strategy is conceivable: focus on first place. You have to want to get the gold. If you decide you’ll be satisfied with bronze before you start, you’ll probably end up sixth. Then you’re done for.’ This was May 1985, in conversation with the Dutch national newspaper <span class="fft-kk">NRC</span> <span class="fft-cursief">Handelsblad</span>. The director of technology Nico Hermans concurred: ‘It may sound arrogant, but we are miles ahead of the competition. We’re simply a class above.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With the infamous ‘<span class="fft-cursief">We hear you, Jerry</span>’ ad running in several electronics magazines, the <span class="fft-kk">US</span> campaign got off to a flying start. This was a cheeky reference to Jerry Sanders, the boss of chip manufacturer <span class="fft-kk">AMD</span>, who had recently publicly called out the unreliability of <span class="fft-kk">US</span> lithography machines and threatened to switch to Japanese equipment.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But for all the bravado, these campaigns from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> were effectively bluffs. Their only machine was the <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 2400, a device hastily assembled to show the chip world they had something better than the oil-driven machines. It wasn’t as accurate as hoped, but the <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 2400 still spat out as many as ninety exposed wafers per hour – a record at the time, according to the ad.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The bold approach worked, and with the help of Steef Wittekoek’s technological expertise, Smit managed to get a foot in the door at <span class="fft-kk">AMD</span>. The reward for their endeavors: a chance for the Dutch to compete with four other suppliers in a test of their capability, a lithographical beauty contest in which the most promising machine gets the contract.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The week of the competition, a lone <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> technician was already on-site. He decided to fire up the machine, just to check everything was in order before the <span class="fft-kk">AMD</span> experts set about their tests. To his horror, he discovered an embarrassing fault. The electric motors were warped, and the test machine was projecting deviant chip patterns. The machine did not stand a chance.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Without telling <span class="fft-kk">AMD</span>, the teams in Veldhoven set to work. Tension was high: they had only thirty-six hours to come up with a solution. The next day, an <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> engineer flew to Silicon Valley with a modified version of the motor parts in his suitcase. With a ‘borrowed’ access pass in hand, the crew snuck into the chip factory in the middle of the night to screw in the motors. The wily scheme paid off. The machine worked and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> eventually won the contract, promising the delivery of twenty-five machines by 1987.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span> proceeded to set its sights on the chip companies just below the top end of the market. These were the manufacturers in a position to compete, yet looking to find ways to expand their production at lower costs. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> figured they would be more willing to take a risk on the Dutch newcomer that promised more ‘value of ownership’. Players like Intel or <span class="fft-kk">IBM</span> would not want to risk their market position, so would be difficult to lure away from the tried and tested lithography machines from Nikon and Canon. After all, the Japanese chip companies had enjoyed great success with these machines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Famed for their optical technology and high-quality cameras, Nikon and Canon had the means to develop their own specialized lenses in-house. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was not so fortunate; it had to look elsewhere to source the optical system, the heart of the lithography machine. The German lens specialist Zeiss had by far the best technology <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> could find, but the company was reluctant to supply to an unknown start-up. Not only that, but Zeiss itself would need to make extra investments to actually produce the highly specialized lenses <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> required. The Germans didn’t dare; they only wanted to sell non-custom-made items.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In a demonstration of confidence in the nascent machine, Philips placed an order. The deadline was tight, but in 1986 the electronics company received the first truly competitive wafer stepper: the <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 2500, equipped with a standard lens from Zeiss. The beginning was here.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Meanwhile <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International were unable to keep up with the capital injections demanded by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Del Prado was particularly annoyed by Smit’s ability to casually burn through huge sums of money. On one of his returns from Taiwan, Steef Wittekoek needed to travel to New York to talk with <span class="fft-kk">IBM</span>. Smit told him to ‘just take the Concorde’, a supersonic plane that commanded equally impressive costs to fly.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For his part, Smit was also annoyed with Del Prado. In his eyes, the chip pioneer of the Netherlands had failed to grasp that lithography was a business in its own right. And <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needed to take the market by storm: they had no hope of success if they indulged the Dutchman’s penny-pinching. Smit made an inquiry to Philips about whether it was possible to buy out Del Prado. The response: don’t even think about it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This was a step too far for Del Prado. He vowed to take Smit to task, and an upcoming trade fair provided the opportunity. <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> international and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> were due to share a stand at the event, held at a race track in San Mateo. Here, between the cowboys of the chip industry and surrounded by the smell of horses, beer and hotdogs, the two collided. As soon as Del Prado asked, ‘Can we talk?’ Smit knew what was coming. A colleague had even just whispered, ‘Arthur hates you,’ but he hardly needed the warning. Smit’s time was up. In 1987, after taking up an offer from a German company, he left <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Del Prado quickly conjured up a new chief executive, a British man named Clive Segal. However, on his first day, Segal failed to show up. A second day passed – still no Segal. The <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> managers took it in turns waiting for him by the entrance, but no one knew who he was or had any way of contacting him. As it turned out, Segal was also none the wiser. He didn’t realize he had said yes to Del Prado, and was waiting to sell his own company before making any sort of move. But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was in no position to wait. Thankfully Wim Troost, a retired chief executive, agreed to take the reins until the ship was steadied.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One year later, and against his will, Del Prado was out. By this point <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International did not have the capital to fund the upcoming rounds of investment <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needed, leaving them no choice but to withdraw from the joint venture. In 1988 Philips took over Del Prado’s share, which ironically gifted the company full ownership of the wafer stepper they had so desperately wanted rid of.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But things were slightly different this time round, at least on paper. By cleverly depositing <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International’s stake with the NMB bank, Philips made sure <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s government subsidies would continue to flow in. With the stage set, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> could finally begin to make good on their word. The bluff was no longer a bluff.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And with that, Arthur del Prado bid farewell to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. The narrative since has emphasized Philips’ involvement in the early years of the company, and the role of the other founder has largely been ignored. ‘Art’, as he was known to the Americans, never found peace with this. The lack of recognition for his contribution would weigh heavily on him until his death in 2016.</p>
