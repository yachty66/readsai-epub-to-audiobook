			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Gonzalo Suarez – or ‘Gonzo’ to friends – knows his place in history. He points to the ceiling of his office. During the Second World War, the headquarters of the Manhattan Project were housed right there, directly above on the fifth floor. From that very place, General Leslie Groves led the development of the first American atomic bomb in 1942.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The year is 2023, and this government building in Washington now houses the Department of Foreign Affairs. And it is home to a new frontline: the technology war with China. Here, Deputy Assistant Secretary Suarez of the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation carries out his mission to ensure that ‘an industry with strategic security value’ does not fall into the hands of the enemy. He learned the tricks of the trade at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. For instance, diplomats love to laugh, but when they want to convince you of something important, they will drop the volume of their voice until you can barely hear them.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Suarez was involved in all the discussions about export regulations that the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> held with the Netherlands and Japan. But unlike Gonzo from the Muppet Show, the blue bird constantly trying to grab your attention with outlandish stunts, ‘Gonzo’ Suarez operated in the background. Since 2021, he has been overseeing the negotiating teams striving to clip China’s wings. For example: if it were up to the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, Chinese factories would not be allowed to produce chips with ‘finfet’ transistors. These are fin-shaped switches that can be used in a processor at the smallest level. The first finfet technology came onto the market in 2011, and companies such as <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, Samsung and Intel subsequently developed better switches that changed a ‘0’ into a ‘1’ even more efficiently. For these switches, advanced chip machines and design software are needed, something China would no longer receive if the <span class="fft-kk">US</span> government had its way.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> developed a plan to set China back by fifteen years, through choking China’s access to advanced chip technology. To achieve this and to set limits for American suppliers, the departments of Commerce, State, Defense and Energy each sent a delegation of two or three specialists knowledgeable in the field of chip industry supply chains to form a team. From 2021 on, they would meet via secure video connections or at the <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> office in the Eisenhower Executive Office building. The <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> dominated these discussions, and largely left the diplomatic negotiations to Suarez and his team. For the technical details, they consulted the experts from the Pentagon or the American Ministry of Energy.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">You cannot produce a good chip without high-quality etching machines, measuring equipment and devices to apply the wafer-thin layers. And for all this, you need a supplier such as Applied Materials, Lam Research and <span class="fft-kk">KLA</span> – all billion-dollar enterprises, although their market value had dropped slightly below <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s. American companies had been making huge sums of money from chip production in China – exactly as Peter Wennink said – and they risked losing a large portion of their revenue due to the export restrictions. It was something they continually complained about to the Biden administration. ‘That criticism hasn’t died down. But we’re trying to proceed surgically to avoid causing major economic damage,’ was Suarez’s diplomatic response. Behind the scenes, this was accompanied by fierce discussions between the Department of Commerce on one side, and the Pentagon and the State Department on the other. And it led to endless changes in the overflowing shared Google document, edited by the Americans under the watchful eye of the <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Meanwhile, China’s technological advance marched on. In the summer of 2022, it became apparent that <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span> was capable of producing 7-nanometer chips using standard scanners from the Netherlands. The West may have taken away <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>, but that did not stop China’s progress. And to improve their chips, Chinese factories were using equipment that mainly originated in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. In technical terms: <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s immersion scanners project lines to an accuracy of 38 nanometers. Anything below that is the responsibility of alternative chip machine suppliers. That stings in Veldhoven: they feel the <span class="fft-kk">US</span> is shifting the economic damage to its industry onto the Dutch company.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But time was running out, and the Biden administration was no longer willing to wait to intervene. With the midterm elections looming in November 2022, Republican opponents were accusing the Democrats of being too soft on China. They demanded stricter measures.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And they got them. The first details were leaked in the summer of 2022, and on Friday October 7 the full plan was made public. The timing was a work of diplomatic precision: it was just before Xi Jingping was set to announce his third term in office, but not too close to the National Congress of the Chinese party that it would give Xi reason to adopt an even more aggressive stance towards the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. Despite this meticulous preparation, neither the <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> nor the State Department bothered to come up with a captivating codename like the iconic ‘Manhattan Project’. Suarez had to laugh: ‘We’re a bunch of boring bureaucrats, so we just called it “the measures”. We forgot to come up with a code name.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Bureau of Industry and Security presented the technical details in a 139-page document. Even Kevin Wolf, the world champion of export regulations, was left reeling. ‘I’ve been doing this for thirty years and knew what to expect. But I had to read all 139 pages ten times over to make any sense of this jumble of rules.’ In his eyes, the American export rules were simply too complicated for mere mortals to understand.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Throughout his time at <span class="fft-kk">BIS</span> during the Obama era, Wolf designed the export regulations now at use in this tech war. He was the one who used the Entity List to bring the Chinese telecom company ZTE to its knees. Now, the legal expert guides tech companies through the treacherous forest of export regulations for the prestigious law firm Akin Gump. The entrance to their office on <span class="fft-kk">K</span>-Street, the heart of the Washington lobbying circuit, is large enough to park a few trucks side by side and not worry about denting their doors. After all, lobbying is big business in <span class="fft-kk">DC</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To maximize its technological advantage over China, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> built ‘a high fence around a small yard,’ in the words of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. But for chip companies and suppliers, it was difficult to gauge where exactly that fence stood. In short, they were no longer allowed to supply tools that would enable Chinese chipmakers to produce processors finer than 14 nanometers. Chip factories producing dynamic random-access memory (<span class="fft-kk">DRAM</span>) were limited to 18 nanometers, and storage memory (<span class="fft-kk">NAND</span>) could consist of at most 128 different layers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The scope of the export regulations was expanded to cover all advanced commercial chips, which, according to Wolf, made things particularly complicated: ‘During my time at <span class="fft-kk">BIS</span>, I designed the rules for specific semiconductors that could serve military purposes, such as programmable processors and radiation-resistant chips. Now, the measures were aimed at an entire country.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The rules were precisely tuned: in general, restrictions for China did not apply to <a id="_idTextAnchor042" class="calibre3"></a>companies as a whole, but were determined per factory, and sometimes even per production line. This kept the supply of less advanced chips from China intact. After all, the Americans still want to be able to buy their cars and washing machines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, panic swept through the chip industry in October after the announcement, prompting Kevin Wolf to work the longest hours of his career. Companies were particularly alarmed by the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Persons clause, which prohibits American citizens from working for Chinese chip companies. The stock prices of American chip machine manufacturers immediately plummeted, as chip designers like Nvidia and <span class="fft-kk">AMD</span> suddenly found they were no longer able to supply their most advanced chips to China.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> erred on the side of caution, and American employees were required to temporarily suspend their activities in China until the exact legal implications were clarified. ‘Our announcement was quite sloppy,’ an <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> member later admitted. But at least that way, the 139-page document grabbed the attention of the worldwide industry all at once.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The measures also affected foreign companies operating chip factories in China, such as <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and the South Korean memory manufacturers Samsung and<span class="fft-kk"> SK </span>Hynix. <span class="fft-kk">BIS</span> quickly came up with an amendment and granted these companies a one-year extension. But this was not very helpful. Typical investments in chip factories are counted in billions of dollars and take place over several years, not just over one year.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In November 2022, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte embarked on a tour of Asia. Wherever he went, the topic was the same: <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. First, he spoke with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Bali, where Xi warned of decoupling the economies of Europe and China. A few days later, Rutte met with South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol in Seoul, where they joined a chat between <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s Peter Wennink and the leaders of Samsung and<span class="fft-kk"> SK </span>Hynix. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had been expanding in South Korea, but the Korean president wanted to see the Dutch company make extra investments in his country to accommodate the ‘reorganization’ of the semiconductor industry. The conversation with Rutte and Wennink was widely publicized in the Korean press: it was as if two Dutch prime ministers had been visiting. Even though Martin van den Brink was also in Korea, he stayed out of the spotlight. He had technical discussions with clients to focus on.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> had taken the first step on October 7. Now, Japan and the Netherlands needed to follow suit with their measures. From outside the White House, a Bloomberg reporter relayed from an anonymous source that the ‘deal’ was almost complete. The leak was a clear message to the Netherlands: let’s get moving. But the responsible Dutch ministers, Liesje Schreinemacher of Foreign Trade and Micky Adriaansens of Economic Affairs, responded in interviews with <span class="fft-kk">NRC</span> with their own message: the Netherlands needed more time to make a thorough and considered assessment, and in any case would certainly not copy the American export rules word for word.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">On a Friday afternoon just before Christmas 2022, three Dutch ministers convened at the headquarters of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in Veldhoven to speak with Peter Wennink and Roger Dassen. Accompanying Adriaansens and Schreinemacher was Wopke Hoekstra, Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> sought to rally as many allies as possible to defend the interests of the business community. Their stance was that the Netherlands had already made enough concessions with the export ban on <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> technology, and the ministry feared that even more drastic measures against <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would impact other Dutch companies that also do business in China.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Convincing three ministers is one thing, but ultimately the decision is up to the boss. Prime Minister Mark Rutte had to make the call. In his eyes, national security trumped economic interests, especially at a time when the world seemed on the brink of exploding and China was moving in unpredictable ways. The Chinese threat was not imaginary, and neither was the scale of diplomatic pressure from the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> government. The Netherlands was taking a similar stance to Washington, and it was dragging <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> along with it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The trilateral cooperation was settled at the end of January 2023. Mark Rutte finally got his invitation to the White House, which had already hosted Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida earlier that month. In front of the press, Rutte and Biden showered each other with compliments, and the warm relationship between the two countries was further kindled in front of the fireplace of the Oval Office. The name ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ was never mentioned, but a slip of the tongue betrayed what was on the American president’s mind: ‘our companies…our countries collaborate closely to tackle the challenges posed by China.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">While Biden playfully let the Dutch prime minister sit behind his desk, security advisors Sullivan and Van Leeuwen went to meet each other in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. As far as they were concerned, the trilats were over. But there were no signed documents, nor any pens exchanged. This was a mutual agreement between allies, and the start of a long-term partnership. Now came the hard part: figuring out the details.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When Minister Schreinemacher announced in early March that the Netherlands would implement export control measures in conjunction with Japan and the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, it was still unclear exactly how those would unfold. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> immediately issued a press release in consultation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. According to the company’s assessment, only the sale of the newest generation immersion scanners would require a permit.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But that was far from set in stone. Although the ‘deal’ seemed finalized, negotiations about technical limitations were still ongoing. And if the Americans had their way, negotiations would never end. The <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> continued to insist on rolling back China’s existing capacity, which would mean that some of the machines <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> already delivered would have to cease operations.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This was a best-case scenario for the Americans. To the Netherlands, it was unthinkable. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had over eight hundred lithography machines operating in Chinese chip factories. Without maintenance, repairs and spare parts, the most advanced versions would quickly grind to a halt. Veldhoven had obligations to prevent this from happening, and it wanted to fulfill them.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> had the ability to force <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to pull the plug, but they were reluctant to play that card too quickly. Even Trump never reached for it – such aggressive measures were considered unfitting for such a carefully crafted alliance. America preferred the softer option of using additional rules to ‘plug any loopholes’ in the agreements, which meant even more work for the already overloaded Bureau of Industry and Security. On the second floor of the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Department of Commerce in Washington, 350 people were frantically trying to keep a grip on the jumble of restrictions, sanctions and transactions in the chip sector.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But there was a catch.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> export regulations made a distinction between Chinese chip factories and multinational companies that run factories in China. Additionally, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> created a third, extra-sensitive category of Chinese production lines. Dutch chip machines were completely barred from these, and even the maintenance of their existing machines was prohibited. These production lines totaled nine factories, six of which contained <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s scanners. According to the Americans, those fabs made chips used for military applications. Because these Chinese companies often changed their names and addresses, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> wanted to be able to expand its blacklist immediately, without time-consuming consultation with their trilateral partners. The export controllers likened it to a game of whack-a-mole; you <a id="_idTextAnchor043" class="calibre3"></a>have to hit them quickly and you never know where the next one is going to pop up.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This distinction in its export rules meant the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> would be able to directly influence Dutch export policy. For the Netherlands, that was not an option. Sovereignty mattered: without it, they could not ensure restrictions were only imposed for security reasons, not economic considerations.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The dispute was left unresolved, and the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and the Netherlands agreed to disagree. The deal remained open-ended, and the resulting uncertainty became a constant thorn in <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s side. If at any point the Dutch government chose not to cooperate, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> could draw on the dreaded de minimis rule and force <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to terminate contracts with its Chinese buyers. In Veldhoven’s eyes, this gave the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> license to curtail Chinese chip manufacturers for its own economic reasons. Unlike a game of chess that ends with a stalemate, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> found itself locked in a seemingly never-ending struggle with no clear resolution in sight.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The Netherlands was opposed to a further decoupling of the Chinese and Western economies. The Americans insisted this was not the intention – hard to believe when listening to the Republican hawks in Congress. Loudly demanding more aggressive attitudes towards China was still their favorite pastime. But their constant calls were predominantly political grandstanding – an easy way to score points without having to follow through.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, the <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> did want to be able to ‘upgrade’ the export regulations, just in case Xi Jingping extended his hand to Taiwan or decided to support Russia in the war in Ukraine. In case of emergency: break the Chinese chip factories. The only thing they needed was the hammer. The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> has several tools at its fingertips that it could use to thwart China, such as denying the country access to commonly used American chip design software or to the British company <span class="fft-kk">ARM</span>’s ubiquitous chip designs. And with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, the Netherlands has an unprecedented economic weapon within its borders.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This is a large responsibility for a small country. To stand stronger among the great powers, the Netherlands continued to seek more multilateral support. In March of 2023, it proposed to add the export restrictions against <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> to the dual-use list of the Wassenaar Arrangement. It seemed an unusual move, as the Netherlands had previously obstructed an attempt from the Americans to do precisely that. And with ‘Wassenaar’ frozen due to the war in Ukraine, the Dutch diplomats were fully aware of their proposals’ chances. But more than anything, the attempt was a gesture to show the outside world, especially China, the logic of the Dutch measures. If chip machines using extreme ultraviolet light require an export license from Wassenaar, the same had to apply to other techniques that could produce chips at the same level as <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It sounds simple enough. But the geopolitical significance made it a burden The Hague did not want to bear alone. The Netherlands tried to rally other <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> member states to add the export measures to a new European dual-use list, mainly to avoid being the only nation in the line of fire should China come up with countermeasures. But it was too little, too late.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The Chinese responded. Immediately. Mid-March, a Chinese delegation knocked on the door of the Ministry of Foreign Trade in The Hague to discuss the export restrictions. The Chinese had already filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (<span class="fft-kk">WTO</span>), describing the measures as industrial policy masquerading as matters of national security. According to China, America was a ‘bully’ that put its own interests above the rest of the world’s. Vice Minister Ling Ji from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce had a clear message for Liesje Schreinemacher: be careful. The latter stressed that the Netherlands did not want to paralyze the Chinese chip industry, but it would take more than her words to convince them.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In early April, China urged the <span class="fft-kk">WTO</span> for clarification on the new export restrictions. Shortly after, a Dutch delegation met with Chinese export specialists at the Jin Jiang hotel in the former French concession of Shanghai. The location was symbolic: it was the building where Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger signed the first Sino-American agreement in 1972.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Chinese view was that the pressure from the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> made the Netherlands just as much a victim of American protectionism as it did Beijing. As a surprise, the entire leadership of the Chinese chip industry was flown in. Six top executives from companies like <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>, <span class="fft-kk">YMTC</span> and Fujian Jinhua sat across the table. Over the course of an hour, they each made a pitch to the Dutch delegation, each emphasizing how much their production lines depend on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In April of 2023, Peter Wennink flew to China to discuss with chip manufacturers and trade Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao the extent of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s wiggle room. All the Chinese customers were asking, ‘When will it end?’ but Wennink had no answer. The only certainty was that the Americans were not about to loosen their extraterritorial grip on the world, and the Dutch were going to be there to help them.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the end of June, Schreinemacher announced the official measures. A licensing requirement for the export of <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> machines capable of producing chips with a resolution of 45 nanometers or better would be introduced, beginning in September of that year. Most importantly, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> machines capable of aligning subsequent layers of a chip with less than one and a half nanometers of accuracy (or ‘overlay’), would be subject to these restrictions, preventing the Chinese chip manufacturers from using multi-patterning techniques to make advanced chips. This was an attempt to slow down former <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> employee Liang Mong Song, the chip wizard driving China’s tech ambitions, who has been perfecting this technique at <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span> since 2017.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Schreinemacher estimated that twenty machines per year would no longer be allowed to be exported to China without a license. In practice, the restriction only took effect in January of 2024 – as per a silent agreement with Japan and the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> – and made no mention of the maintenance of scanners that had already been delivered. China fiercely protested the ‘unjust’ measures via a public letter from the Chinese embassy. The criticism was sharp: the Dutch were allowing themselves to be used as pawns in America’s game, and it was tarnishing their good name as a trading nation.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Of the more than eight hundred <span class="fft-kk">ASML </span>machines in China, half are located at Chinese chip manufacturers. Most are at <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>, and the remaining at branches of Samsung,<span class="fft-kk"> SK </span>Hynix and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>. By Peter Wennink’s expectations, the export restrictions would have no effect on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s turnover. Foreign chip manufacturers would simply choose to expand elsewhere, and China was diving headfirst into older semiconductor technology anyway. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> tried to keep the scanners coming, but found itself saddled with a mountain of bureaucratic red tape as tens of thousands of components of the ‘forbidden’ machines now required separate registration. Geopolitical barriers emerged everywhere at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> San Diego and Wilton, since no American citizens were allowed to work on some of the products destined for China.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Meanwhile, Chinese customers were increasing their orders of chip machines. In the third quarter of 2023, almost half of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s revenue was coming from China. This was helped by the fact that other manufacturers like Intel and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> temporarily paused their orders due to a dip in the chip market, which automatically pushed the Chinese orders to the front of the line. In addition, the larger Chinese customers tried to stockpile spare parts to prolong the life expectancy of their machines. However, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was reluctant to play along – it wanted to keep to the spirit of the restrictions. Neither did they build a special machine for the Chinese market. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was never comfortable in the gray <a id="_idTextAnchor044" class="calibre3"></a>areas, and had no interest in challenging the Americans by pushing the limits of what was allowed. They practiced what they preached: <a id="_idTextAnchor045" class="calibre3"></a>yes meant yes, and no meant no.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">China was forced to switch to ‘more than Moore’, and turned its focus to chips that were not necessarily reliant on the most sophisticated <a id="_idTextAnchor046" class="calibre3"></a>technology, but were needed on a large scale for purposes such as energy transition, electric vehicles, household items or industrial automation. At the same time, Chinese chipmakers were more careful and avoided boasting about their progress, for fear of being noticed by the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. To avoid restrictions, some factories renamed their existing 14 nanometer technology to ‘17’. No one wanted to catch the eye of the Americans.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Meanwhile, in 2023 Huawei launched a 5<span class="fft-kk">G</span> phone with a 7 nanometer chip from <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span> – proof that China was lagging behind, but was still not at a standstill. The production method for this chip was so labor-intensive that it was uncertain <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span> would be able to make this chip in large volumes. Technically speaking, the 7 nanometer chip was nothing new, but that did not stop Huawei gloating about it when<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Trade Secretary Raimondo travelled to China. That was asking for trouble, and fingers were immediately pointed at Veldhoven. The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> pressed the Netherlands to slam the brakes before January 2024, and the cabinet duly revoked several approved export licenses for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> machines destined for China. As it turned out, Washington actually pulled the reins because <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was exporting far more <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> machines to China than had been expected. As the chip industry was pushing the pause button, China kept on hoarding. In Veldhoven, Peter Wennink was tasked with breaking the news to the Chinese customers, all via video. The machines were ready to be shipped, but the Americans insisted that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> halt its shipment immediately. ‘Close the gates, now!’ Veldhoven was told. On top of that, the <span class="fft-kk">US</span> had tightened its grip on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s exports to China by adjusting the ’de-minimis’ rules.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To escape the American chokehold, the Chinese government encouraged its own chip industry to develop alternative machines. This seemed to work for Fujian Jinhua, a Chinese factory that had been added to the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Entity List in 2018. Fujian Jinhua converted to produce processors for Huawei. The Chinese chip manufacturers appeared to succeed in replacing Western technology with the help of local chip machine makers like Naura and Amec. Even though no American chip machines had gone to Fujian Jinhua in four years, wafers were still rolling off the production lines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This is where the crucial input of knowledge workers comes into play. China learned vast amounts from<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> companies through former employees who brought their knowledge back home. Amec has progressed to the point where it supplies chip machines to <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, and even sued its American competitor Lam Research for patent infringement.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But lithography is a different story. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> swept up the last remnants of American lithography technology from <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> in 2001, which meant there was no recent expertise in that field to collect from the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. This makes the Dutch scanners indispensable to China – for the time being.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">China still has one competing manufacturer of lithography machines: <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span>, or Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment. Founded in 2002, the company makes it no secret that it tries to copy the art of lithography from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. The Chinese even openly ordered one of Veldhoven’s <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 5500s in their early years in an attempt to unravel the machine’s secrets. This did not lead to a sudden boost in the development of Chinese technology, as <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s devices are far too complex to simply copy. <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span> had a slow start, as Frits van Hout and Martin van den Brink observed when they visited their competitor in 2018 and 2019. The visit came out of curiosity: they wanted to get a feel for what challenges the Chinese were facing. Despite financial assistance from the government, <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span> remains fifteen years behind compared to what <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has to offer.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Now, this Chinese company mainly supplies machines for the back end, which involves the processing and packaging of existing chips. When it comes to the front end – the actual production of chips – it remains stuck at 90 nanometer technology. <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span> is working on better technology, such as 28 nanometer immersion systems, but those experiments prove to be difficult. Chinese chip factories prefer to use proven technology from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Nikon, rather than take a chance on homegrown concoctions. So far, anyway. On occasion, you might see a <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span> system on display in Chinese factory lines. However, these machines are likely there for show, or to impress government officials, with the bulk of chip production done by foreign-made lithography systems operating elsewhere.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, the export restrictions on China are offering <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span> a new perspective. If even more drastic measures are taken to block <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Nikon’s scanners, it would back Chinese manufacturers into a corner. They would have no choice but to go for <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span>, automatically giving <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s competitor more experience and the opportunity to work out the kinks in their own machines. <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span> would get more money, which in turn could be invested in the development of new technology, such as an immersion scanner of their own. As China is growing increasingly isolated, so too is the likelihood of a fully-fledged Chinese competitor emerging in the rear-view mirror capable of developing an independent chip production chain.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This is the exact opposite of what the Americans wanted to achieve. And this is what makes their strategy utterly incomprehensible to the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">China’s reaction followed in July of 2023, shortly after the Netherlands published its measure that scaled back <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> exports. It imposed restrictions on the global export of gallium and germanium, two types of metal the chip industry relied on the Chinese for. The measure was far from drastic – China was still too dependent on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Rather, China wanted to flex its powerful position as the world’s largest supplier of rare metals, the raw materials the entire global industry needs for technological products and energy transition. It was a jab to let the West feel what could happen if China was further restricted.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The geopolitical fault lines were not only evident in the chip sector, but across the entire technology supply chain. Major electronics manufacturers that relied on China as a production hub started shifting part of their manufacturing process elsewhere. Apple began expanding operations in India, after being left reeling from protests in Zhengzhou, during which Foxconn employees shut down the largest Chinese iPhone factory. Samsung started to relocate its Chinese factories to Vietnam. Companies hoped that by reshoring – or ‘friendshoring’ – they could diversify their risks and bypass the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> import tariffs on goods from China. But completely disentangling from Chinese component suppliers and their massive electronics factories proved impossible. Where else in the world could you mobilize fifty thousand skilled workers at the push of a button to quickly assemble some extra phones?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The fluctuating internal regulations caused the economic climate in China to worsen. President Xi often intervened personally in the business sector, springing unforeseen and unclear new laws on the entrepreneurs. After the radical <span class="fft-kk">COVID</span> lockdowns – which were lifted just as abruptly as they were implemented – the long hoped-for recovery struggled to gain momentum. The Chinese real estate market collapsed, unemployment rose, and foreign investments in China sharply declined.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Neither was Xi’s flagship Made in China 2025 strategy going as planned. China continued to rely heavily on imported chips, and the share of Chinese factories in global chip production remained small. According to the <span class="fft-kk">SIA</span>, in 2021 it was just under eight percent. Meanwhile, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and Europe were adding fuel to their own chip fabs. Because if there is one thing the West does as well as China, it is showering the semiconductor industry with subsidies.</p>
