			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Over the course of his forty-year career at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, Van den Brink created a larger-than-life version of his own character. A company so focused on the machine that everything outside of it seems to fade away. He is often compared to Apple founder Steve Jobs: they share the same combination of temperament and strategic insight, along with an eye for detail and clever marketing. And just like Steve Jobs, Van den Brink does not just give his customers what they ask for – he tells them what they need. And they trust him. You can recognize the traces of Apple’s formula throughout <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s strategy: the full integration of hardware, software and services, complete with a Genius Bar in Brabant.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘All nonsense,’ grumbles Martin. ‘This company doesn’t stand or fall with one person.’ In his eyes, his influence on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> all came down to timing. He was lucky enough to build on the inventions of the pioneers at Philips: as far as Martin is concerned, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has existed for fifty years, not just forty. In addition, he is the last person in management who worked with the entire lithography machine. Naturally, this meant his number of roles expanded. Martin oversees research and development, intellectual property, engages in discussions with chip manufacturers, and, in his spare moments, comes up with new inventions. In 2022, Van den Brink registers a machine learning patent – his personal contribution to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s ‘voodoo’ software from Silicon Valley. The drive to understand the most complex technology has not left him, although with the breadth of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s technical prowess, it is a challenge to keep up.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">After eight years of sharing the helm, Peter Wennink and Van den Brink renewed their contracts for two more years in 2022. The growth explosion, the coronavirus, the logistical nightmares and the geopolitical chaos all came together at once, and neither wanted to step down and leave <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> hanging while in the spotlight. ‘It was like a freight train plowing towards you out of nowhere, smashing through everything in its way,’ as Wennink describes it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">What will happen when the two close the door on this chapter of their lives? Who will step in and fill the void?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the past few years, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has groomed a new generation of managers. Chief financial officer Dassen took over some tasks from Wennink, stepping in to represent the Brainport region and shake hands with politicians in The Hague. When the Dutch and Belgian kings paid a visit to the imec institute in Leuven, he was the one attending on behalf of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. And he is not just a friendly face: in 2021, Dassen led the commercial negotiations with Zeiss alongside Christophe Fouquet, the French board member responsible for the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> product line. The latter joined <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in 2008, after previously working at Applied Materials and <span class="fft-kk">KLA</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In addition to Wennink, Van den Brink now also takes other executives on a walk. It’s his way to share knowledge and exchange ideas undisturbed. When it is Fouquet’s turn, he trudges for two hours through the pouring rain at seven o’clock in the morning. The outside world is also getting to know the Frenchman: in June of 2023, Nikkei Asia and the <span class="fft-cursief">Financial Times</span> published an interview in which he explained his view on the ‘impossible’ decoupling of the worldwide chip industry.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But there will never be another like Martin. According to Herman Boom, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> will need a group of people to take over his roles. Boom, who led the development department and later the <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> product line, is described as a ‘mini-Martin’ by his colleagues, and he is certainly a fan of Martin’s leadership style. ‘I never caught him telling you what to do. He just makes sure that you yourself feel you need to do it.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink’s power of persuasion lies in his childlike enthusiasm, says Sunny Stalnaker. ‘It works like some kind of reality distortion field. Martin can disrupt your perspective until you’re convinced that you can make the impossible possible. He’s the reason I’ve stuck around for thirty years.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">That enthusiasm also manifests itself physically, according to Stalnaker. You should never sit to Martin’s right, and if you do, be prepared – something is bound to happen. Peter Wennink also knows this. He once joined a work meeting in Sunny’s hotel room in Korea, and saw there was only one spare seat: on Martin’s right. As Van den Brink launched into a fiery speech, he knocked a glass full of ice water all over Wennink’s laptop and pants. Cursing under his breath, he flipped his laptop on its side to let the water drain out.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin is slightly clumsy, as Wennink later explains in his office. He imitates Van den Brink by walking around with a slight loll to his gait, his feet turned outwards. Those feet are asking for trouble. One Saturday morning, they ran into each other at the car dealership where they both buy their Porsches. They were standing around, having a cappuccino and admiring the sports cars, when one convertible caught Martin’s eye. He walked over, caught his foot on a car tire and toppled over, spilling his full cup of coffee all over the leather upholstery. ‘Shit,’ he muttered to himself.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Every four years, Van den Brink exchanges his Porsche Cayenne at the dealer, full of dents and dings. ‘Actually, it’s too flashy a car, just like a lot of my colleagues have. We said it twenty years ago: it’s not wise to drive a flashy car when things are not going so well for the company.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Yet cars are the favorite toys of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s top management. Peter Wennink prefers to not flaunt his prized collection of Porsches, but Roger Dassen’s love of Italian sports cars is well known. ‘Mr. Dassen is more public about it,’ says Van den Brink, pausing to consider how to finish the sentence. ‘But that’s just one aspect of someone’s life. You should appreciate each other for your similarities, not judge the things you wouldn’t do yourself.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">He doesn’t want to preach, but he believes that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> employees should be both modest and helpful. At moments like these, Van den Brink’s upbringing still shines through. Although he is no longer religious, growing up in the Dutch Bible Belt leaves a lasting mark on you.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Reconciling his own wealth with this Calvinistic nature does not come easy. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s executives’ compensation is aligned with that of international tech companies, and they earn millions per year. This is an enormous amount of money, as Van den Brink is well aware. And since 1995, his stock portfolio has only gone up. ‘I’ve never found that an interesting parameter. It’s a luxury to have this problem, I know.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">There is no shame in being rich, but it’s bad-mannered to flaunt it. That is why Van den Brink is so unhappy to be photographed with his horse for the 2001 staff magazine. ‘Horseback riding is expensive! How to explain to others that I live such a generous life? Other people will think I am completely full of myself, and that I am more concerned with making myself bigger than the company I work for.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It would be easy for the financial success to go to the heads of the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers. Each year in March, during profit-sharing, the shops in Brabant notice that the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> employees are suddenly tens of thousands of euros better off. And on top of this, there are also short- and long-term bonuses. These generous salaries are the reason why the people who work there call <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> ‘a golden cage’. You cannot tell by looking at it: the plain straight and angular buildings scream functionality. Only the Plaza restaurant is playfully designed – it needs to feel inviting somewhere. The same artwork has been hanging in the offices of the presidents for years, but no one seems bothered.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As a traveling <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’er, you continuously fly all over the world. You can guarantee a well-organized trip, but not much more than that. The engineers fly premium economy and receive a daily allowance of 60 to 100 euros when they stay abroad for a longer period. The VP’s fly business class, while the other employees only get an upgrade if there are fewer than sixty days between their intercontinental trips. When you step off the plane, you get to work. And if you have to do one or two weeks of mandatory solitary confinement in a lonely quarantine hotel? Suck it up – that’s just part of the deal. This also goes for the supervisory and executive boards. When they go on customer trips together to the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, they often stay in bang average hotels, with carpets from the eighties and drop-ceilings. The chip world revolves around yield, not around the jet set.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This Dutch frugality has long been the chip machine maker’s trademark. Had you been a customer visiting Veldhoven twenty years ago, you would have been treated to a cheese sandwich and a glass of milk. They figured that manufacturers were there for the machines, not for the lunch. Nowadays, they are a little more extravagant – there are also croissants.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span> was born south of the rivers that divide the country, but it grew up with the Calvinist spirit of the north. This fits the role it wants to play: not of an arrogant tech company striving for maximal returns, but of a steward for suppliers that add value to the chip industry.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The danger is that these norms and values will fade when the most characteristic carriers of the culture depart. Van den Brink will leave a gaping hole, and not just because of how many roles he combines. In this void, insights and motives that he specifically put an end to will now have room to grow, feeding <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s greatest fear of letting more politics and ego creep into the organization. Van den Brink is less worried. According to him, from day one his company has attracted people who naturally put technology and the company above themselves, people who just want to be one piece of a big puzzle. He shares this notion with Peter Wennink. ‘No one is important, there are only positions with a lot of responsibility,’ the latter declares. Easy to say when you’re the boss of a company that turns over 27 billion in revenue. When his wife asks if he realizes that people see him differently from twenty years ago, Wennink admits he finds it tough.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">By talking to the technicians in the company, one might underestimate his role: after all, he lacks a technical background and is less outspoken than Van den Brink. However, Wennink’s skills made sure that the ‘cowboys’ in the company had enough room to play and kept the most explosive characters on board. During one conversation, he walks over to a framed cartoon in his office – a gift from a consultant who assisted the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> management. It’s signed ‘Petriduct’ – for Peter, builder of bridges.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span>’ers usually keep their work and private lives separate. That’s what you get in a company where you are not supposed to take anything personally. However, Martin is one colleague Wennink will definitely continue to see after his departure. ‘He’s authentic and he’s genuine. That’s difficult in a world where not everything is pure and you often have to make compromises.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">That is what Peter does best – act as a buffer for the outside world. Martin regularly storms into Wennink’s office when he is upset about something or with someone. Wennink lets the tirades wash over him. ‘I just wait until the balloon is deflated. I want to know what got him so worked up – if there’s something fundamental behind it, I need to help him.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink needs these buffers. In his early years, he was fortunate to have Steef Wittekoek as his guardian angel. ‘He was my advisor. I often came in furious, spouting stuff like, “this is crap,” and “that doesn’t work”, and then Steef would just let me sit for a while. I always calmed down, it was very soothing.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But he never sits down for long. Every minute that can be spent working, Van den Brink is working. Even during meetings at ASML, where everyone has to pay attention to what is being presented, Van den Brink is always on his laptop. No one dares to question him. Presentations for investors or shareholder meetings? Great – a perfect moment to get some work done. Either that, or he will go and find a spot in the room nestled between the audience, where he can put his head down and work through technical drawings. His comments are always extensive. That is his secret to his continual mastery of complex materials: brute brain force.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">After one such presentation, Wennink is approached by a retired investor. ‘Does Mr. Van den Brink perhaps take the minutes?’ he asks in an affected tone. Wennink bursts out laughing as he recalls the moment, tears in his eyes. Then his voice drops in volume. ‘Martin is someone special to me,’ he responds. ‘There’s a high level of affection.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘They seem like a married couple,’ laughs Sunny Stalnaker. She can see Peter rolling his eyes in meetings when Martin gets carried away or starts ranting. ‘There he goes again,’ sighs Peter, trying to calm him down. ‘Martin, Martin, Martin…’</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Acting on the world stage is exhausting.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Are you at least taking it a little easy?’ Van den Brink asks his fellow president.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is spring of 2023. The two bump into each other on the twentieth floor in Veldhoven, when Wennink has just got back from China and Van den Brink has returned from the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. ‘I notice you’re busier than ever,’ he adds.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink knows that Wennink likes to be visible to the outside world. But he also sees that his colleague is tired after his two-year-long ordeal.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is not clear whether his concern got through to Wennink. ‘As soon as it’s about himself, Peter won’t be so quick to tell you that he’s listening,’ he says. In a soft voice, he adds, ‘Peter finds it difficult to say no, so he quickly gets completely swallowed up by commitments.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">They haven’t seen each other in four weeks. In recent years, that is unheard of. They normally drop in on each other far more often, especially now that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is growing so quickly and is preparing for new leadership. In such times, you have to see each other frequently. And calling is not an option. Conversations on the phone with Martin are always short – he wants to look you in the eye.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘We missed each other,’ Wennink concludes. Time for a walk in the Kampina.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">It is a Friday evening in May, and the tower in Veldhoven is nearly deserted. Wennink locks up behind him. The secretaries have already gone home, and the lights are off in the office across the hall. With his worn briefcase in hand, the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> logo barely legible to the world, he walks to the elevator.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Since the <span class="fft-kk">IPO</span> in 1995, there has been one large arc leading up to the success of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>, the most complex machine on earth. It was a journey Van den Brink and Wennink largely took together. Like yin and yang in high-tech land.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin has one regret – about ten years ago, he said no to a documentary maker who wanted to follow the development of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. He didn’t dare take that risk: ‘Back then, I was afraid that everyone would laugh at me if <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> didn’t work.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But it did work. And with it, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> wrote a new Dutch fairytale. Not about Hansje Brinker sticking his finger in a dike. But about Martin van den Brink, the man who spent forty years putting his finger on every sore spot he could find.</p>
