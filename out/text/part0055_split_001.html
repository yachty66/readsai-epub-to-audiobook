			<p class="ff-platmetwit">If he wants to tell you something, he usually starts with an unrelated question.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Thomas, when are you retiring again?’ Martin asks.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘In about ten years, I think,’ answers Thomas Stammler, the technical director at Zeiss. It is the summer of 2021, and the two are taking a moment to celebrate Zeiss and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s new commercial agreement. Beer is flowing, the food is excellent: the perfect time to look ahead.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Let’s make a plan for the future then, for five or ten years after you retire.’</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">During the last forty years, the lines printed by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s machines shrunk from a micron to a few nanometers. That is about a thousand times smaller – a journey that went from the invisible to the almost immeasurable. Each time it seems impossible that a machine could direct photons onto the light-sensitive layer of the silicon wafer even more accurately. So far, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has managed. But where does it end?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As the High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machine draws closer to production, so too does Van den Brink’s retirement. But Martin is determined not to let this be the final jewel in his <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> crown. ‘You shouldn’t stop after the last thing you made. I want to leave a legacy I won’t see the end point of.’ However, that point on the horizon already has a name: Hyper <span class="fft-kk">NA</span>. Whether that machine will actually arrive is not certain. But what is ever certain at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">After the conversation with Thomas Stammler in 2021, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> asks Zeiss if it is possible to design an <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> optic with an even larger lens opening. If High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> has a lens opening of 0.55, Hyper <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> would go beyond 0.7, a feat that would allow it to expose even finer chip structures. The lens is the best option, but if you increase the size of the mirrors, you will have to scale up the whole scanner. And the machine is enough of a beast as it is.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Designing the High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machine had already been more complex than anticipated. The wide angle lenses were tricky, the wafers needed to move at even higher speeds, and mirrors needed to be accurate enough to hit a golf ball on the moon. But with these technological mountains conquered, Oberkochen has the mental capacity to take on a new challenge. From a technical standpoint, this new dot on the horizon seems reachable. Zeiss does not expect Hyper <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> to need any radically new measurement technology, which will save valuable time. It is just not clear who will cough up the money to buy the machines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As the monopolist in <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>, Veldhoven seems to call all the shots when it comes to introducing new lithography. But there is one wildcard Veldhoven cannot ignore: the economy.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Moore’s Law has run its course. At the current pace, doubling the transistors every two years is simply not sustainable. According to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s director of research Jos Benschop, progress is limited by economics and not by physics. Unhindered, he figures it would still take another forty years before an atom would no longer be able to pass between the lines on a chip.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">If you believe the marketing departments of semiconductor manufacturers, chip patterns are still rapidly shrinking. The latest craze is to describe their tech in ångströms – a tenth of a nanometer. However, this terminology hides the fact that the chip industry is fast approaching the point where the investments required to scale further down become too large to recoup – that’s the real limit. And if chip manufacturers can no longer add value to Hyper NA machines, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> stands to gain nothing by producing them. In layman’s terms: it is getting too expensive.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">There are only a handful of large chip manufacturers who can still afford the most advanced chip machines. If Intel fails to stay in the race against Samsung and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, only those two front runners will remain. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is not concerned about how many chip manufacturers are left, as long as the underlying market continues to grow as predicted. And there is no reason for concern. Increasing amounts of computing power and storage are needed for data centers, for processing data deep within communication networks, for smarter industry and healthcare, for the energy transition, and for making artificial intelligence even more intelligent. The world is addicted to data, and it is proving to be an impossible habit to kick.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Manufacturers of these kinds of chips want what Hyper <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> promises to offer: the chance to print even smaller details for complex structures at the nanoscale. The chance to gain more power. For example, a new and more efficient generation of transistors has replaced the old finfet technology, called ‘gate-all-around’ or nanosheets. Rather than fin-shaped, these switches are more like microscopic tubes that are pinched, and lose less energy while changing a 0 to a 1.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is also trying to convince memory chip manufacturers to order Hyper <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machines. But for <span class="fft-kk">NAND</span> chips, used for data storage, these smallest lines are no longer necessary. <span class="fft-kk">NAND</span> chips consist of hundreds of layers stacked on top of each other, creating a 3D structure with relatively coarse details. And there is a possibility that <span class="fft-kk">DRAM</span> chips, used for working memory, will also be stacked. If it all goes up, scaling down will slow down. But much to his own surprise, after discussions with manufacturers, Van den Brink believes Hyper <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> to be compelling for the manufacturing of smaller memory cells. ‘Yet once I’ve made a client excited about something, I start doubting myself the second I walk out the door. If we go for Hyper <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> and have that thing ready in ten years, it could turn out completely different.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">He may have built <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> into a monopolist, but Van den Brink always emphasizes how dependent the company is on chip manufacturers. ‘No matter how much money we make, we rely on our customers. If you lose sight of that, it will go wrong.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But chip manufacturers are also entirely dependent on Veldhoven. With High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span>, they pay 400 million euros for a machine that doesn’t even work when it is shipped. All they have that guarantees any return on their investment is <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s promise that they will make it happen. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s limited production capacity is also a weapon used in the competition between chip manufacturers. When Intel bought the very first High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machines, they did so knowing that Samsung and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> would have to wait longer for their units as a result. This move is the first step in Intel’s ambitious plan to beat the competition.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Some chip makers deliberately stick to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s older machines, as these systems still have Japanese alternatives. It gives them some bargaining power, and a stick to wield if they are unhappy with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Because of its dominant position, Veldhoven needs to constantly stay sharp. This is why Martin preaches humility on all fronts. His greatest fear is that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s enormous market power will open the door to arrogance or complacency – just like it did for Nikon in the 1990s. The Japanese dominated the market for lithography machines, but their failure to keep up with the demands of chip makers created the space for a new competitor to step in. If there were problems with the lithography machines, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> took accountability and resolved them. Nikon was less flexible, and consequently, it watched the market slip out of its hands.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Colleagues who do not understand the ‘stay humble’ approach are ‘taken by the hand’ by Martin. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers should not only solve the pain of their customers – they should also feel it. When an engineer suggests that the problems with warped wafers a chip manufacturer is facing is of their own doing, Martin’s eyebrows shoot up. ‘Of course it’s on them and not us,’ he responds cynically. ‘You know what, we’ll just stop using wafers in the machine altogether. Problem solved.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">If a small gesture will smooth things over, you never have to think twice about making it, says one manager. ‘You’ll never get in trouble for giving away a lens worth a few million euros. But if that same customer calls Martin because you refused to cooperate, you get your butt kicked.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Each day the company stays at the top, the harder it is to imagine a future where it would fail. It may feel part of the natural order of things, but as Van den Brink knows, the world does not work that way. He understands why this is hard for the younger generation to grasp: after all, they have yet to experience a severe chip crisis or mass layoffs. ‘Some think that everything will just happen automatically, that everything we come up with will work. If we succeeded twice, then of course the third time will work as well.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">He cherishes his paranoia. Danger lurks around every corner. Doubt courses through his veins, even when he consults with his engineers about the path they are embarking on. ‘If we’ve made a decision to turn right, then I’ll go home and lie awake that night, wondering: do we really need to turn right?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin is no stranger to risk: after all, there is no other way to describe <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s decision to invest billions into an impossible <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> program in the early ’90s. At the same time, Van den Brink is afraid to take the wrong turn. In this, he sees no contradiction. ‘I never gambled with the company for the sake of it. We always had another strategy on hand to keep making money.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the next ten to fifteen years, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is not only betting on linear scaling down – that is, increasing the number of transistors per square millimeter. In addition, improvement in the fabs will come from the optimization software and metrological inspection, soon to be enhanced with the technology from Mapper. With this, you can make sure the layers of the chips fit better together with minimal shifting. All these measurements feed into the lithography machine, which also makes the technology harder to replicate: an insurance for the distant future.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Now that <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> is somewhat reliable, developers have turned to upgrading their other scanners. The chips in demand for the automotive industry are made with less complicated <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> machines, and even older <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> systems – the ‘vintage’ models from the ’80s. It’s a rapidly growing market, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is not about to let it slip through their fingers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the same time, engineers are trying to improve the yield and availability of existing <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines. The light source is still a limiting factor, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> ultimately wants to get the frequency of the droplets from fifty thousand to one hundred thousand times per second. As long as it doesn’t all explode, says Van den Brink.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The droplet can also be fragmented more effectively. Currently, the laser hits the famous tin pancake in two strikes. However, it is not perfectly flat – think of it less as a crepe and more as a pizza with a thick crust. It means not all of the tin is fully utilized, but if you add an extra pulse to the laser, you can pulverize the droplet. As you might expect, this three-stage blast yields more power.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the coming decade, everything will revolve around energy. The pace of scaling down may be slowing, but the energy consumption of chips continues to decrease. To achieve this reduction, chip manufacturers are experimenting with new materials and metals, the names of which would leave your high-school chemistry teacher speechless. Another trick is to stick together multiple specialized components of one chip, called chiplets, into one system which creates a more powerful processor. Combining these semiconductors into a single package is complex, yet <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> plans to triple the energy-efficient performance (<span class="fft-kk">EEP</span>) every two years. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s role is critical to providing the tools necessary to reach that goal. In 2021, Martin presented this <span class="fft-kk">EEP</span> prediction as a guideline for the next ten years. Moore’s Law may be slowing down, but Martin’s Law soldiers on.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The efficiency of the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> scanners remains a weak point. The laser consumes an extremely high amount of power, of which a great deal is wasted. The solution to this problem is to be found in Ditzingen, a town near the Southern German city of Stuttgart, where Trumpf builds the lasers that breathe life into the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Compared to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s austere buildings, the Trumpf factory looks like a modern museum. It boasts sleek lines, built in steel, wood and concrete. An underground network of corridors connects the immaculate production halls with the round Blautopf restaurant, which serves a warm midday meal as soon as the clock strikes noon. Lunchtime in the German state of Baden-Württemberg is always precise and on the dot, just like their lasers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In a nearby test chamber, a Trumpf engineer puts the triple laser amplifier through its paces. The mixture of <span class="fft-kk">CO</span><sub class="fft-subscript">2</sub>, helium and nitrogen produces a painfully sharp hissing sound plus a laser beam as powerful as a jet engine. Fifteen large computer racks surround it to control the power. The giant machine is so incredibly complex, so packed with delicate mirrors, pipes, filters and sensors, that it can take experts weeks to locate errors.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">After the test, the 17-ton laser is dismantled, manually cleaned and shipped to the chip factory to be placed in the subfab. There, it is connected to the lithography machine via a periscope, where it can finally begin blasting droplets. Together with Cymer and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, it took Trumpf years to adapt the laser to the requirements of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. But the hard work is paying off: 1,500 people work in Ditzingen on the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> lasers, and they generate 800 million euros in revenue each year. More than enough to transform the factory into a modern architectural masterpiece.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> laser is more powerful than anyone could imagine. But why stop here? In the cleanrooms of Ditzingen, the Germans are working hard to crank out every last ounce of power. One way to better utilize the energy is to use a separate solid-state laser to trigger the first, gentle blow. This would no longer consume gas, leaving extra power for the hard hit.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Saving energy is a must. Trumpf did the math: in 2022, Ditzingen supplied over seventy lasers to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. When these run at full capacity, they consume as much energy in a year as all of Stuttgart’s 630,000 residents combined.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">That is not something to be proud of. According to an estimate by Greenpeace, the energy consumption of the global chip sector will increase to 237 terawatt-hours by 2030, double what it was in 2021. That’s comparable to all of Australia’s energy use. Greenpeace also estimates that the consumption of the world’s largest chip manufacturer, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, will triple in the same period. The forecast is troublesome for Taiwan, where the chip industry already heavily burdens the local infrastructure. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> consumes more than six percent of all the energy on the island, and in some regions uses ten percent of all available water for cooling.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But while an <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine drains vast amounts of power, the chips it produces are more energy efficient than their predecessors. Overall, this saves the world energy in the long run. However, as they know at Trumpf, you can make the generation of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light far more efficient by increasing the frequency of the droplets. The significant amount of heat generated by the laser system is also cooled with water, which could then be used to heat homes and neighborhoods in the area. Any means to convert residual heat into usable energy is welcomed by <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and Intel. They value reducing their impact on the environment, and what the customer wants, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needs to deliver.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Trumpf is on the case and is starting with a new design that cools the laser system at a temperature suitable for being reused in households. As a former specialist in district heating, it is a personal mission for Martin. A new goal has appeared on the horizon – utilizing the wasted heat from <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light. Another part of his legacy to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
