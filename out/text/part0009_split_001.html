			<p class="ff-platmetwit">It feels like the millionth time he’s written this down. With a sigh, Steef Wittekoek puts the finishing touches to his article. ‘Optical aspects of the Silicon Repeater’ would go on to appear in the September 1983 edition of the <span class="fft-cursief">Philips Technological Review</span>. Established in 1936, this was the place to read about the latest inventions from Philips’ Physical Laboratory (NatLab) in the words of the scientists themselves.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With the Silicon Repeater, writes Wittekoek, you can produce chips with far more precision and efficiency than would ever be possible with conventional lithography machines. Essentially, it’s a big photocopier that repeats itself over and over, step by step. First, it projects an image field through a highly specialized lens onto a silicon disc, topped with a light-sensitive layer. This circular disc – also referred to as a <span class="fft-cursief">wafer </span>– then moves around as fast as possible, from one exposure step to the next. This carries on until the entire disc takes on the image: in this case, a pattern of miniature transistors. The adjustment and focusing of the Repeater was also completely automatic, making the machine faster and more efficient than its competitors. Ultimately, his point was simple; if the chip industry wants to take its next leap forwards, this is the tool it needs. When Wittekoek, one of NatLab’s top scientists, reread his praise of the Repeater’s ‘excellent specifications’, he couldn’t help but feel a kinship with the machine. Philips had been trying to turn this idea into a good product for more than ten years. The first versions of the Repeater dated back to 1973, and even these were based on breakthroughs made by NatLab researchers Herman van Heek and Gijs Bouwhuis two years prior. But so far, it had been met with silence.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Gijs Bouwhuis was a talented optical scientist with an impressive list of patents to his name, responsible for devising the technology underlying the CD player and the lesser-known Videodisc player. Having grown up during World War <span class="fft-kk">II</span> in the far north of the Netherlands, he was able to pursue his studies when his assistance was no longer needed on the family farm. As his daughter Pien recalled: ‘My father was a modest man – working at the NatLab was a hobby to him. He would always be puffing away on his pipe when he was thinking, much to my mother’s irritation.’ Shortly before his death in 2016, Bouwhuis and his former NatLab colleagues were given a tour of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to see the fruits of their old hobbies one last time.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The CD was a commercial hit for Philips, finding its way into living rooms for years to come. But a lithography machine is a different beast. A product far more complex than a CD player and of no interest to the mass consumer market, it was by all measures a deeply unsuitable investment for an electronics giant in danger of decline.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the early ’70s, Philips had over 400,000 employees, approximately 90,000 of them working in the Netherlands. As an old-fashioned conglomerate everything was designed and made in-house, ranging from TVs, radios, medical equipment and household appliances to lighting. This included the industrial machines needed to produce these electronics, as well as the integrated circuits to control them. At the time, this made it the second-largest manufacturer of semiconductors in the world. But their chip factories had grown tired of the existing machines. They were far too slow and produced too many unusable chips. So, at their request, the NatLab set to work developing what would become the Silicon Repeater.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Philips’ NatLab was a sanctuary for free-thinking scientists and inventors, and attracted a great degree of technical expertise. It quickly established itself as a breeding ground for pioneering innovations, comparable to the famous Bell Labs of the American telecom giant <span class="fft-kk">AT&amp;T</span>. But while the NatLab was constantly brimming with new ideas and patents, the wider organization may as well have carried the patent on bureaucracy. Doing something new in Philips required an unthinkable amount of consulting and political strategizing, a style of business totally unsuited to the high-paced innovation that drove the chip industry. Speed was everything – and Philips did not stand a chance of keeping up.</p>
