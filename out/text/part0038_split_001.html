			<p class="ff-platmetwit">‘Sorry, you have to take your pants off too.’ Zeiss’ top technical executives Peter Kurz and Thomas Stammler don’t mess around. Whoever steps foot in their heavily secured cleanroom needs to wear not only a dust-free suit, but also fiber-free underwear. After being blasted for twenty seconds by an air shower, you can then enter the production hall in the south German town of Oberkochen. Here, Zeiss works on what lies ahead.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s next generation of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines goes by the nickname High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span>. These colossal scanners span 14 meters and feature large mirrors up to a meter wide. The optical system by itself consists of twenty thousand parts and weighs twelve tons, making it seven times heavier than the optics for the current <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine. With this growth comes a new price tag: while a ‘normal’ <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> system costs around 200 million euros, the new variant is expected to be double that.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The value of High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> lies in its ability to print chip structures with a precision of 2 nanometers and smaller, a reduction in scale made possible by the higher opening angle of the lenses. In technical terms: the numerical aperture (or <span class="fft-kk">NA</span>) increases from 0.33 to 0.55 – the difference between Low <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> and High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s suppliers have been working on parts for this new machine for years. Zeiss needed to begin production early on due to the extensive preparation demanded by lens fabrication. This prompted <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to take a stake in Zeiss in 2016, which used the investment to kickstart the research process. It took five years to figure out all the ingredients required.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Zeiss’s advanced laboratory sits between the mountains in Oberkochen, constructed on a thick layer of vibration-free concrete. There, with the help from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, the lens maker developed the measurement technology needed to manufacture the new mirrors. <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> mirrors are not flat like the mirror in your bathroom. They have complex shapes – think of the distortion you get from a mirror at a funfair. The difficulty is being able to measure whether the surface is smooth enough all around to reflect the light without disturbance. ‘If you can’t measure it, you can’t make it,’ as the Germans say.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Kürz and Stammler walk down the stairs into a scene straight from a James Bond movie. The center of a cavernous room holds two gleaming steel cylinders, each as wide as a submarine and sealed off by massive vault-like doors. Figures clad in blue cleanroom suits carefully shuffle around the space-age technology. These cylinders contain a vacuum with the same chemical composition as the lithography machine and are used to check the mirrors for deviations. Here, they count by the atom. A data center in the left corner processes the terabytes of measurement data for the calculations. Behind the cylinders, a yellow robot systematically takes mirrors from a rack. They are far too heavy to be lifted by a human, and far too valuable to drop.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Even the smallest deviation will be visible in the wafer, so the mirrors are constructed from a material that is virtually unaffected by temperature fluctuations. Thankfully, Zeiss is able to draw on knowledge from its former aerospace division. While satellites and chip machines seem worlds apart, they both need to perform their tasks under extreme conditions.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For months, the surface is polished by robots, after which Zeiss shoots off the remaining atoms one by one. More than fifty ultra-thin reflective layers are then applied, and the mirror is ready. ‘If you lined it up right, you could hit a golf ball on the moon with one of these,’ says Thomas Stammler. And he has more comparisons: if you could stretch the mirror from a High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> system until it was the size of Germany, the largest irregularity would protrude at most 20 micrometers from the surface. That’s less than the thickness of a single human hair.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is perfectly normal to feel dizzy in this place. Not because of the sterile air, but because the mere thought of the extremely complex tools needed to make the chips destined for the phones of the future can make you lightheaded. A machine invented in Veldhoven, manufactured with parts from all over Europe and shipped to chip factories in Asia and the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, where it produces silicon wafers full of processors and memory chips that, in just a few years, will end up in the palm of your hand.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Fortunately, Jan van Schoot stays on top of it all. As <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s system architect, he was involved in the design of the original <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine, as well as the new High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> generation. The machine needs to undergo <a id="_idTextAnchor032" class="calibre3"></a>a large number of adjustments to meet the demands of the new optical system. As he says, ‘you’re constantly creating new problems’, and it is up to him to solve them.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The light is bounced throughout the entire <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> system: first from the light source to the mask, then from the mask to the silicon wafer. Each mirror absorbs 30 percent of the light rays, and the new High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machine has two mirrors fewer than the first version. This effectively means more light and a faster exposure, which saves valuable time for the manufacturer.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">So why not make a machine with these large mirrors in the first place? As Van Schoot explains, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> does not like to jump straight into the deep end. ‘The equipment for measuring mirrors is getting increasingly complex. Each time we ask ourselves how far we can push it and how much risk we’re willing to take. With the first optics, we took it as far as we could with the available technology.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Chip manufacturers also need to be able to keep up the pace. The area in which the light beam is razor sharp is now slightly smaller on the new system. Think of a portrait photographer who only brings your eyes into focus and leaves the rest of your face blurred. As a result, deviations on the surface of the wafer require extra attention, and the layers applied by other chip machines need to be even thinner.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Another problem: the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light falls at a steep angle on the mask in a High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> system, causing only a small fraction of the pattern to be properly reflected. An anamorphic or ‘widescreen’ mirror is used to fit more patterns on the mask, but the field of view is smaller and the chip design has to be adjusted to accommodate this.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And then there’s ‘dead time’, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s morbid term for the valuable seconds when the wafers are not being exposed. The speed of the wafer tables has been ramped up to cut this down: they now accelerate to their position under the light with a force more than ten times that of gravity. Faster than a fighter jet. This is not even the quickest part of the machine – the mask with the original chip pattern moves four times as fast. To keep these forces in check, a counterweight races in the other direction.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This combination of brute force and atomic precision is controlled by software. Computing power is also needed to calculate the positioning of the mirrors, with a series of sensors constantly monitoring how they behave and how this affects the image on the wafer.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Thomas Stammler swings open the door to a new production hall, where the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> mirrors are assembled in series. A knocking sound from a worker nonchalantly hammering a piece of optics with a rubber mallet echoes through the hall. But no one’s alarmed – even in the world of high-tech, low-tech tricks are known to come in handy. The mirrors ultimately hang in the system in such a way that no force is exerted on the material. There is no escaping gravity, but the mirrors still seem to be ‘floating’, according to Zeiss.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In a nearby room, robots practice with dummies to pre-program the movements. The actual High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> mirrors are already in the making, albeit in various stages of completion. It takes an entire year to fabricate and perfect a single mirror.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The entire system of mirrors will soon end up in the ‘optical train’. The complete lithography machine is an awe-inspiring monolith, as tall as a two-story house and filled with futuristic technology. The cleanroom also needed to expand to accommodate the sheer size of it. You can tell from looking at the Zeiss campus where the High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> optics are assembled – it’s the tallest building in the area.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Zeiss itself has roughly a thousand employees working on the new technology. Regular meetings with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> help to keep the collaboration running smoothly. With the knowledge from Veldhoven now completely intertwined with that from Oberkochen, transparency is everything. ‘It’s worse than a marriage – we can never get rid of each other now,’ jokes Martin van den Brink. And at Zeiss, they make exactly the same joke. The terms of the marriage are simple: Zeiss provides optics only to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> exclusively uses optics from Zeiss. They completely share the intellectual property, and the old slogan ‘two companies, one business’ still holds true. Neither side has any desire for a complete takeover. The Germans want Carl Zeiss SMT to remain independent because of the money their semiconductor division brings in, with revenue growing from 1.2 billion euros in 2016 to 3.6 billion in 2023. It is the result of a fruitful long-distance relationship, and there is no interest in rocking the boat anytime soon.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Zeiss may have been prepared, but the High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machine failed to meet the intended introduction date of 2022. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and their suppliers were swamped by a rapid rise in demand for other types of scanners, forcing them to push back the schedule for these latest machines. To save time, the Leuven-based research institute imec immediately used the first High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> machine in Veldhoven for production tests, with couriers shuttling the exposed wafers back and forth to the cleanrooms in Belgium. Breaking down and rebuilding the system in Leuven would have cost an additional year, and the chip industry couldn’t afford to wait. Intel stands first in line to receive the inaugural High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> system. Seven freight planes were needed to transport the machine from Veldhoven to Intel’s research base in Hillsboro, Oregon. It’s the world’s biggest copier, weighing 150 tons. It will be at least 2025 before these machines begin producing chips.</p>
