			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Around 2001 the chip industry faced an important decision. What would be the next wavelength for lithography machines? The chip factories were pushing for lines thinner than 100 nanometers (100 millionths of a millimeter) as smaller wavelengths meant the ability to project far finer chip-structures. All the current technology offered was a broad-tip marker, and they were searching for a fine liner.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Every advance by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in reducing the wavelength was followed by adjusting the resolution of the projected lines. This meant improving the lenses in the new machines, with each step requiring a larger aperture. The physical phenomenon is described by the Rayleigh formula, and every tech-head in the industry knows it by heart. As soon as the physical border of the lens comes into view, it is time for a new light source. You can think of this as swapping the color, although at this point, they all remain invisible to the human eye which only sees rainbow-range wavelengths between 400 and 750 nanometers (or violet to red).</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the ’90s, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had replaced their mercury lamps, limited to 365 nanometers, with lasers capable of producing deep ultraviolet light, initially at 248 and ultimately 193 nanometers. But the chip industry needed more. The limits of what was possible with 193 nanometer lithography were close to being exhausted. A new number was floated: 157 nanometers. Together with Zeiss, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> invested money into research for this new technology, but the material for lenses capable of 157 nanometers proved to be very expensive. No longer expecting enough profit, Intel dropped out the race in 2003 and other chip factories soon followed suit.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This was a blow to the Brabanders. Their hefty investment in research had been in vain and most of the extensive preparatory work found itself flushed down the drain. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> wasted no time grieving. They were already working on something more promising. Nonetheless, to fulfil requirements for a European subsidy, they still sent a 157-test machine to imec. The device was never meant for operation, nor would it ever be used.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This failure proved a costly lesson. The chip manufacturers had made down payments of 300 million euros for machines that, due to the spook in the market, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> never followed through with. That money needed to be refunded, much to the irritation of the lithography manufacturer. Notes were duly taken in Veldhoven: going forward, it would be vital to ensure customers also have some share of the risk when pushing for the next leap in technology. Everybody should have skin in the game.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">157 nanometers proved to be a dead end. However, there is one light source that carries a far shorter wavelength of just 13.5 nanometers: extreme ultraviolet light. It would require painstaking years of research before the industry could make use of this. In the meantime, the chip industry needed inspiration from elsewhere to keep Moore’s Law alive. Fortunately, the solution was something ever-present in the life of a Dutch engineer: water.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In the 17<sup class="fft-superscript">th</sup> century, the Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snellius investigated how light rays refract as they pass through one material to another. The law Snellius derived was later published by his compatriot Christiaan Huygens, pioneer in theoretical physics and optics. Even today, their work is still a must-read for every engineer at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The advance this yielded was significant. By holding a thin layer of pure water between the lens and the wafer, you effectively get the same result as increasing the size of the aperture. This allowed the engineers to push past the limits of what was thought possible with 193 nanometers, all without needing to change the light source itself.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">You can experience this for yourself by looking down at your legs in a shallow pool. The surface of the water refracts the light rays, and as a result your legs seem horribly short and your feet closer than ever. This everyday phenomenon was precisely the foundation from which <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> took the next technological leap. By applying water between the lens and the wafer, extra small details were able to be projected by the lithography machines. They called the technique immersion, or “dipping”.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, a different type of optics that combined transparent lenses and mirrors was needed. The task fell to Zeiss, who set about building such a system for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Creating the desired effect required only a teaspoon of water, no more than the bottom of a shot glass. However, this puddle needs to stay completely still on a silicon disc rapidly firing back and forth. Anyone who has tried to keep a glass full of water steady as they run will know how difficult this is.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘We just couldn’t come up with anything that would work’ said Frits van Hout. When he returned to the company in 2001 he found the engineers completely stuck on how to manage the wet wafers. ‘<span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> was desperate to make use of immersion, so they suggested using a raised lip to keep the water in place. Impossible.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Eventually, the breakthrough came in the form of a mini-swimming pool held under the lens. With this <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> avoided having to immerse the entire wafer, and could keep it to only the part lined up to be exposed. A continuous stream of air blown over the disc, like a ‘ring of air’, was then utilized to keep the mini pool stable.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For this to work, however, no air could come between the lens and water. Furthermore, the layer of water had to be precisely the same depth throughout, which was difficult because the lens is naturally curved, not flat. In days gone by, engineers at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Zeiss had flattened the last lens in the optical system to be able to check the alignment of the wafer. Although thought to be obsolete, the function had never been removed from the design. This accidental sloppiness then had proved itself extremely valuable now.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The first immersion-machine hit the market in 2004, immediately putting the Japanese competition at a disadvantage. The already expanding Dutch market share was pushed ahead even more by the introduction of another groundbreaking invention: the TwinScan. This new machine could measure for alignment and illuminate at the same time, performing a high degree of complex multitasking that shaved off invaluable time for chip factories.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This is how it works: before a new pattern can be printed on a silicone layer, the wafer must first be measured. This information is needed to align it before exposing it, so the new layer will fall exactly on the previous pattern. Already difficult, but the real problems stem from the degree of heat the wafer has to endure in the ovens. This can cause the wafer to warp, like a Pringle potato chip. What looks like a perfectly flat disc to the naked eye is revealed by a microscope to be more like a rugged mountainscape.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">So, before any measurement can take place, the wafer is carefully suctioned into place, which removes the worst of the bumps. Sensors then record the remaining deviations, creating a detailed 3D map of the surface with all its peaks and troughs. The lithography machine then uses this map to adjust the focal plane during exposure, compensating for the deviations so the chip patterns are projected at an equal sharpness over the whole surface. Think of it like the autofocus on a camera, rapidly correcting the image at miniscule distances and depths.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Immersion and the TwinScan turned out to be a match made in heaven. Making this 3D map is best done with a dry wafer, and with the TwinScan you could undertake the wet exposure while the next disc, still dry, was already being measured. Just like doing the dishes with an extra pair of hands.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The tables of the TwinScan were driven by powerful motors, able to accelerate and decelerate in an instant. But directing the two simultaneously turned out to be far more complicated than imagined. The first TwinScan system <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> delivered in 2000 only carried the one wafer-table. It would need to wait some time for its sibling to arrive.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A sophisticated name was spun to gloss things over: the TwinScan ‘Single’. But despite limping to market on one leg, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> knew the machine would have no difficulty being sold. This new generation of lithography machines exposed wafers with a diameter of 300 millimeters, roughly the size of a vinyl record album. This was still a significant increase on the 200mm industry benchmark, allowing for more chips to be produced. Just like an album holds more songs than a single.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Once again <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> took the route of deliver first, improve later. This also worked in favor of the chip factories, allowing them to try out producing the most advanced – and most profitable – chips before competitors. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was happy to play along; after all, such an early delivery was also a sure-fire way to keep their own competitors out of the chip factories. As Martin van den Brink put it: ‘If we wait until our machines work, then we’re already behind.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">That strategy seemed to work. With immersion technology and the TwinScan, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> gained valuable market share at the expense of Canon and Nikon. In the meantime, Veldhoven was already pouring money into research for the future <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine, as yet with no profit. But with their two cash cows ready to milk, the twin-tables and the wet wafers, the Dutch engineers hoped their heads would remain firmly above water.</p>
