			<p class="ff-platmetwit1">Now that his retirement is rapidly approaching, Peter Wennink is less diplomatic than usual. He publicly expresses his disappointment in Dutch politicians, who ‘lack vision and leadership’ and limit <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s possibilities to grow in the Netherlands. This is a jab at Mark Rutte, the prime minister who is eyeing a leadership position at <span class="fft-kk">NATO</span>. In December of 2023, when Rutte visited the local chip industry in Arizona together with a Dutch delegation, Wennink was absent. Instead, he chose to travel to Washington to meet with the National Security Council and the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Department of Commerce, where he tried to convince them to be less drastic with their measures. To him, these talks never felt like beating a dead horse: ‘Things could have been way worse,’ he says when looking back in February 2024.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">After stepping down from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, Peter Wennink is looking forward to a new chapter. He will join the supervisory board of the Dutch brewing company Heineken and has invested in a French vineyard, indulging his passion for wine. The goodbye gifts are starting to pour <a id="_idTextAnchor082" class="calibre3"></a>in, and are piling up on his desk. An investor just sent Wennink a token of appreciation: a bright-orange Porsche 911 Lego kit. ‘I have the real one myself,’ the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> chuckles.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin van den Brink is in a less celebratory mood. During his last presentation to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s top executives about the company’s future, he was visibly emotional. Before giving the floor to Christophe Fouquet, he stayed silent for a long time, and then declared: ‘It’s your roadmap now.’ His colleagues gathered around, their eyes locked in silence.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> story has come full circle. Van den Brink is set to join the supervisory board of <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span>, the same company created by Arthur del Prado in 1968 that co-founded <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> forty years ago, together with Philips. But, as he discloses in his office, Van den Brink will also remain a part-time advisor to Veldhoven.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Even so, letting go is painful.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘This is a tough one,’ Martin says, wiping away his tears. He walks to the coffeemaker hidden behind his office. A cappuccino, like always, and a deep breath. ‘For me this was never a job. It never felt like work.’</p>
