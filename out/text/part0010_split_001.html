			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Steef Wittekoek felt like a lone voice crying out in the wilderness. He knew that the Repeater (later renamed the ‘Wafer Stepper’) was a step above its American competitors. But back in Eindhoven, Philips had other concerns. Their turnover had relied heavily on consumer electronics, and the rise of Japanese companies like Sony,<span class="fft-kk"> JVC</span> and Toshiba had forced the Dutch multinational into a difficult position. While Sony was preparing to take the world by storm with the Walkman, Philips was busy taking a knife to the organization. The strategy: to spin off costly parts of the company via joint ventures, before gradually selling their stakes in the part.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Eyes soon fell on the lithography machines. In early 1978, Philips had the idea to set up an independent branch for the technology, a move that would also allow for the sale of the devices to external customers. But enthusiasm among the management was thin on the ground – there was a vague idea, but no real plan. Only Wim Troost, deputy director of the Science and Industry division, raised his hand. Already dealing with products for industrial applications, he glimpsed the potential of the technology and fancied the challenge. As far as the other division heads were concerned, the technology was a total dead end and a complete waste of time.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Wim, stop throwing away money,’ he would frequently hear. But it was of no use. He had made up his mind.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Upon meeting Wim Troost, you immediately sense that you are standing face to face with someone from another era. Born in the mid-1920s, Troost was raised in a time when the first radio sets were released, the stock market stood on the cusp of the crash of 1929, and World War <span class="fft-kk">I</span> was still called The Great War.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Cut to the early 1980s, and just as he was about to retire, Troost found himself playing a decisive role in launching the chip-machine manufacturer that would come to be called <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. If it were not for Troost, Philips would have written off the wafer stepper entirely. As it was, the budget allocated for the responsibility hardly gave him a chance to begin with. He still pronounces ‘budget’ with a hard Dutch <span class="fft-cursief">g</span> in the middle: an echo from a long distant past.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When Troost opens his front door in the summer of 2022, he is almost 97. Tucked away in the garden of his converted farmhouse, he recalls how he would drive back and forth to the Philips plant from this same house every day, his journey cast under the smoke of neighboring Eindhoven. Despite being frailer than he once was, his memories remain razor-sharp in his mind. Just as clear are his hand-written notes, covering the events of these years in painstaking detail.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Troost recounts the visit of PerkinElmer, a leading<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> lithography systems manufacturer that developed their own machine to great commercial success in the ’70s. Now the early ’80s, the company was intrigued by reports of the NatLab’s inventions. A delegation of ten Americans was dispatched to the Netherlands. Stunned by what they found, PerkinElmer decided they wanted to work with Philips. However, they heard nothing back. Philips never even responded to them, a short-sightedness that still annoys Troost some forty years later. ‘The management had absolutely no forward vision, no idea of what was possible,’ he bemoans.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Troost knew it would simply never be profitable to only produce chip machines for Philips’ own factories. With this in mind, he travelled to Asia and the <span class="fft-kk">US</span> in an attempt to garner interest in the <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 2000, or the Philips Automated Stepper, the first commercial version of the wafer stepper. The number 2000 was popular at the time in Philips, with the twenty or so years to go before the turn of the millennium lending the number a distinct air of futurism they hoped would rub off on any product it graced. Who wouldn’t want a <span class="fft-kk">P</span>2000 home computer, or a Video 2000 system? However, the reality never caught up with the branding, and none of these Philips products were successful enough to make it to the year of their namesake.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 2000 was no different – though in this case, it was clear why. This version of the stepper had an ‘oil table’, hydraulic motors that moved the surface on which the silicon disc lay. But oil fumes are lethal to the highly controlled environments in which these chips are produced. Cleanrooms have to be clean; if they reek of a garage, you can forget about it. The machine was unsellable.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Something needed to change, so the NatLab set to work on a variant of the stepper with electric motors. They were soon successful, creating what would be known as linear motors due to their back-and-forth motion. However, the cost to complete the development of these motors was skyrocketing. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, which was heavily subsidizing the development of Philips’ lithography technology, had reached their limit and threatened to pull support unless the company focused more time and effort into seeing it through. The walls were closing in, and Troost was short of options. In the end the Ministry itself came up with a solution – why not team up with successful Dutch entrepreneur Arthur del Prado? His company <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International was also working on chip machines and had just completed a successful initial public offering (<span class="fft-kk">IPO)</span> on the <span class="fft-kk">NASDAQ</span>, the American stock exchange. They were the perfect candidates to get Philips over the line.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Arthur del Prado was the pioneer of the Dutch chip industry and a trader of heroic stature. Born in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), Del Prado was interned and forced to endure a Japanese prisoner of war camp as an adolescent. He survived, and made his way to the Netherlands to study chemistry and economics. He then travelled through Silicon Valley in the ’50s, becoming the go-to European distributor for<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> semiconductor technology. By the ’70s, what was now <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International began building vertical furnaces. These machines apply the thin layers to the wafers that are later exposed in the lithography machine. Once the chip pattern is developed on this layer, an etching machine uses gases and chemicals to remove the excess material. The wafer is then sent on a new round through the chip factory until, layer by layer, a chip with transistors and connections grows.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When Del Prado was crowned the 1983 Dutch Entrepreneur of the Year in The Hague, the ministry made sure Troost was invited along. A charming man with an exceptional eye for business, Troost concluded, but he had his concerns. <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International was still primarily a trading house, and Del Prado simply did not have the right connections at a board level. Buying a lithography machine, the heart of chip production, is the single most important strategic decision that a chip manufacturer has to make. Reassurance has to come from the very top; questions need to be run by the board, not discussed with the purchasing department. Especially when taking a chance on new technology.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Philips rebuffed the deal, but Del Prado and the Ministry were insistent. Del Prado had clocked the potential of NatLab’s wafer stepper and wanted in. The jewel in Philips’ crown would take him one step closer to his dream of supplying a complete production line to chip manufacturers – all the tools needed to turn a disc of silicon into a stack of working chips, the power to turn sand into gold. That dream would never fully come true. However, Del Prado’s desire to start a joint venture with Philips would soon be fulfilled.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">No other options arose for Philips to divest the wafer stepper, and it became clear that a deal with <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International was the only way forward. And so it was that Troost, together with his boss at the time George de Kruiff, found himself knocking at Del Prado’s door. The deal for the joint venture was concluded in less than an hour, with both companies putting in 7.5 million guilders (roughly half of the equivalent number in euros) for a 50 percent stake in their joint subsidiary: Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography, or <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> Lithography for short.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In these early months the company presented itself as ALS, until it dawned on them that this was also the name of a serious motor neuron disease. After a quick rebrand as ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> Lithography’, in 1996 the company officially changed its name to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> – a name that has come to be used the world over, and which will be used for the remainder of this book.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The contract was signed in Eindhoven in March 1984. But there was no time to celebrate – there was work to be done. Troost marked forty people from the Philips team that worked on the wafer stepper for immediate transfer. Whether they liked it or not, they would be joining the joint venture. For many, this move struck a bad chord.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The engineers at Philips had been graced with exceptional employee benefits, including a full pension at sixty and access to a fund that helped pay for their children’s education. But now, they found themselves part of an unnegotiable transfer to a breakaway company they all feared was destined for bankruptcy. Even Steef Wittekoek was hesitant. He would only transfer over if the NatLab gave him a two-year return guarantee. The clause was agreed, but he never had to use it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In a makeshift building between the Philips factories in Eindhoven, the administrative department of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> started to settle in. Meanwhile, the technical work pushed on in the draughty hall of a nearby factory. Amongst the workers were two young engineers who would determine the future of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>: Martin van den Brink and Frits van Hout. <span class="fft-cursief">The boys</span>, as they were called, spent little time worrying about their sulking colleagues. Like the other newcomers, they embraced the challenge and threw themselves headfirst into the new technology.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Frits was the first new employee to be brought in under the banner of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Martin was a different story: he was still technically listed as applying for a job at Philips in late 1983, and it would be more than a decade before he got an official contract with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. By then, it was merely a formality – he was already the rock on which the company stood.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The two young hires appeared to be an odd couple: Martin was a physicist specializing in district heating, while Frits graduated in low-temperature physics. Nevertheless, according to Wittekoek the two youngsters were a good combination. ‘Martin was incredibly gifted technically, and while Frits understood the technology, he was more of a people person. He knew how to handle connections the right way.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Troost retired with the start of the company, so the role of <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> was taken up by Gjalt Smit, a former colleague from his days at Philips. Smit had completed a PhD in Astronomy before working for both <span class="fft-kk">NASA</span> and the European Space Agency, ultimately ending up as the director of the Dutch branch of telecom company <span class="fft-kk">ITT</span>. When he quit his steady job for the risky research project, his colleagues assumed he had lost the plot. Looking back at the start of his tenure, Smit can see why. ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was a problem child from day one. In all honesty, it seemed doomed from the start.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Smit nurtured a long-lasting love-hate relationship with Philips. While grateful for what he had learned at the Dutch electronics company, as well as from their ‘finger-licking good’ technology, he always felt the management to be ‘terribly politicized’. Gjalt could never get along with this – he wanted to do things differently.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Gjalt himself <span class="fft-cursief">is </span>different.</p>
