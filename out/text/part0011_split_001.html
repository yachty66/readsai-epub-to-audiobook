			<p class="ff-platmetwit">‘How old do you think this coat is?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It’s early 2023, and Gjalt Smit is walking along the promenade in Montreux, not far from his home in the Swiss mountains. Smit likes to step out in style – this time it’s a dark hat and striking Italian leather coat that reaches almost to his ankles. ‘I bought it in Vienna in 1986,’ he answers with a smirk. ‘The secretary at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was shocked when I walked into the office with it.’ It was as if the secret police had come to Veldhoven.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Smit had always been frank about his dislike for the way Philips worked, something that landed him in good favor with Arthur del Prado when they met in 1983. Del Prado was also not enamored by the corporation, as Philips had shunned <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International when they had previously needed to purchase chip machines. A bond was made, and things clicked between the two men. While this relationship would later sour, culminating in Smit’s departure four years after this meeting, in this short time he managed to establish a winner’s mentality at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> that would define the company for years to come.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When discussing his hobbies, another dimension of his business acumen becomes clear. Smit is a glider pilot. Successfully piloting these aircraft requires a high level of oversight, as well as responsiveness to unexpected turbulence – just like running a business does. In his words, ‘when you are in a glider, you need to know where you are going.’ The same could be said for the young <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, and it was up to Smit to figure this out.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For the first few months, Smit took stock, holding talks in and outside Philips to gauge the lay of the land. As he found out, no-one believed the company had a snowball’s chance in hell – even the employees were not hopeful. Making it in Silicon Valley as a lithography manufacturer required both a decisive organization and machines that were virtually faultless in their reliability. Getting such a company off the ground would take time and money, both of which were in short supply.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But as he also found out, the industry standard machines had hit their limit. A leap in the available technology was now needed to produce chips with smaller resolutions; chips with not just thousands, but hundreds of thousands of transistors, allowing them to perform far more complex tasks. The only problem: a lithography machine capable of producing such a chip would have to be able to project lines approaching one micron (one thousandth of a millimeter) in width. No established lithography manufacturers had the technology for this – but Philips did. They were clueless about the high standards chip manufacturers demanded of their suppliers, however.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the end of May 1984, Smit flew to the <span class="fft-kk">SEMICON</span> trade fair in San Mateo, the heart of Silicon Valley. This was the annual convention for chip manufacturers, like Intel and Texas Instruments, to meet with suppliers of lithographic machines, such as PerkinElmer, Nikon and <span class="fft-kk">GCA</span>. But none of the manufacturers had any interest in Gjalt. As far as they were concerned, there was no need for yet another bidder on the scene, and they weren’t interested in hearing what <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> could offer them in the future. Smit was promptly dismissed. The message: ‘Come back when you’ve sold fifty machines.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Smit was taken aback. He took a plane to the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> office of <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International in Arizona, supposedly responsible for selling his machines on the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> market. However, it was increasingly obvious that <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> International wasn’t aware of the latest developments in lithography techniques, leaving Smit with a growing skepticism about the partnership. To Smit’s surprise, the management of <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> were also uneasy. They feared <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was naïve and would make rookie mistakes.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The memo was clear; with around ten companies still viably competing, the market was crammed enough. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> appeared to be redundant from the outset. Disillusioned, Smit trudged onto the plane back to Amsterdam. As he slumped in his seat, he considered throwing in the towel. No-one wants to lead a company destined for failure. With a bottle of red wine in hand he drifted off, leaving his ideas to hazily float around his head while he slept. After a while, they began to form a picture.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Smit jolted awake – ‘Bingo,’ he whispered to himself. The flight path was clear. Given the scale of investment that had already gone into their machines, the established players would always first defend their existing positions. If <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> could come along with a machine with a far more accurate alignment system, electric motors and precise lenses, they could stun the market and set a standard no company would be able to rise to before it was too late. The leap in technology <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> held the key to would create the opening they needed. But time was not on their side – such a device would need to be ready to go to market, and quick.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A shake out was in the air. Smit returned to <span class="fft-kk">ASM</span> and Philips, asking for an investment of 200 million guilders. This was far more than those in the joint venture had envisioned, but the figure was not plucked from thin air. Philips had previously requested this amount in support from the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. They never received that money, but Smit had done enough to win over the supervisory board. They were convinced: <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was going for gold.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The pilot in Smit had noticed parallels between the chip machine industry and the aircraft industry. Both utilized a diverse range of scientific expertise, converging in the development of one device. But in order to concentrate their efforts on the complex overall industrial designs of their machines, aircraft makers like Boeing and Airbus sourced most of the parts involved. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> quickly embraced this as their modus operandi. Just like aircraft, lithography machines are built in small series and intended to stay in commission for years, with minimal setbacks and optimally utilized capacity. This requires constant maintenance. Marketing also needs to work hand in hand with engineering, as they know exactly how customers can extract the most value from the machine they supply.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This strategy flipped Philips’ approach on its head. For <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, it was now about getting close to customers and outsourcing as much production as possible to suppliers. With the plan rubber-stamped, Smit hired a management consultancy, Hay, to set up the organization. He also brought in employees from America to Veldhoven to help the small Dutch company appear ‘Silicon Valley–friendly’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Smit fostered a culture of freedom at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, guaranteeing engineers the space to figure out their own solutions to technical problems. He often compared his approach to the ‘total football’ of the Dutch national soccer team in the 1970s, a tactic in which every player could be utilized for both attack and defense. The goal was clear: no matter what you do or how you do it, the most important thing is to win.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The number of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> employees grew rapidly. Job listings for new engineers started to appear in trade magazines. A telephone line was set up in Veldhoven for applicants to speak to former Philips specialists, each of whom would personally try to convince the caller to move to the fledgling start-up. The drive worked, and specialists were brought in from fields such as optics, mechatronics, control engineering and software. They used newspapers to hunt for business economists and people to help test the machines, otherwise known as ‘troubleshooters’. Unable to resist the pull of ‘an <span class="fft-cursief">ultra-high-tech </span>company with ambitions to be a world-leader’, people flocked to the calls. Fortunately for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, projecting self-confidence was never an issue.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Sights were set first and foremost on customers in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. During the 1980s Japan was successfully chipping away market shares from American semiconductor companies, and there was no point in trying to pry Japanese chip manufacturers away from Canon and Nikon. So <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> geared itself to become an American-style company, bolstered by a comprehensive and readily available service department. The promise of a strong maintenance crew that could keep the machines running in the factories was essential; after all, every idle second is money lost.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Smit’s optimism was contagious. Although the designers had to work to tight deadlines, hierarchies were kept to a minimum and the employees bought in. The project managers – the ones responsible for actually realizing the machines – found themselves largely in charge. They were told not to worry about the money: all that mattered was that the machines were finished on time, whatever the cost.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Richard George, one of the pioneering engineers of the wafer stepper in the Philips era, recalls this moment as one of relief. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had been inundated with enthusiastic newcomers, and Smit was already sending out growth forecasts that were just as positive. Suddenly, George found himself with 250 more people on his team, and one man in particular stood out to him: Martin van den Brink. ‘Martin was brilliant from the start,’ he recalled, ‘it took him less than two months before he improved the alignment system of the wafer stepper with his own nifty invention. All I could say was, “Damn, that’s a good idea.”’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The machine aligned itself to each wafer one at a time based on two small grid patterns already engraved in the disc. These profiles, or marks, need to remain visible when you apply new layers to the chip to prevent deviations. Van den Brink came up with an improved system that could measure both alignment patterns. The machine worked faster than the competitors with far fewer deviations and his idea was immediately worth a patent. This was huge for the company. In the words of Smit, ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> started out of nothing, like the Big Bang. But the arrival of Martin was an <span class="fft-cursief">act of God</span>.’</p>
