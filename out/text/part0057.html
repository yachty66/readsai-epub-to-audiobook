			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Early photographs at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> show workers kneeling and crouching around lithography systems. Some have their torsos swallowed up by the scanner as they disappear down into the machine, jamming themselves between the metal innards. ASML built a sealed dome, allowing people to fully concentrate with no distractions. They cherish this parallel universe in Veldhoven, even though it is also kind of isolated.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">From day one, this continuous focus on one single product was the ace up <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s sleeve. It allowed the Dutch to set a merciless pace that their Japanese competitors simply could not keep up with. After all, who in their right mind supplies lithography machines before they are completely finished? <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s ability to identify and eliminate imperfections hinges on its close collaboration with chip manufacturers. This level of teamwork ensures the scanners are up and running right on time, churning out wafers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Lithography machine makers in the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> were stuck in the past, and it’s easy to explain why. Market leader Intel followed a risk-averse strategy for high-end chip production. This strategy also impacted its American suppliers, who needed to ensure consistent results in Intel’s factories with significant overcapacity. However, American lithography equipment manufacturers designed their machines with only their most important customer in mind. This meant they lost ground in Asia, where chip manufacturers had been investing in faster production technology. This trend played into <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s hands. The fate of the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> suppliers was sealed, well before the first <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine had even started to run.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">For a long time, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> ignored anything that did not have an acute deadline. This includes the effect its confrontational workplace culture had on its employees, the thinly stretched logistics, and the vulnerability of sensitive data. When it came to restructuring its internal organization, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was haphazard at best. That approach fits a pattern: in Veldhoven, things needed to go terribly wrong before any changes were made. A strong firefighting culture is deeply ingrained into the company, as evidenced by Willem Maris’s 1999 parting interview with Dutch paper<span class="fft-cursief"> de Volkskrant</span>: ‘Every day, something or other collapses around here.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s goal-oriented approach extended beyond its engineers. The company also set clear objectives for its strategic <a id="_idTextAnchor080" class="calibre3"></a>decisions, and was able to grow through a series of bold acquisitions, deep collaborations and investments based on ten- or fifteen-year forecasts. They bypassed the largest economic pitfalls by requiring customers to put down a deposit or agree to invest, and grew more resilient with every take-over attempt and patent attack they faced.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> represents the culmination of decades of experimentation and industrialization, built on the legacy of the Philips engineers. By relentlessly refining their designs, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> engineers have ensured their lithography machines keep pace with Moore’s Law, constantly pushing the boundaries of performance without reaching a breaking point. Like a rubber band stretched to its limit, but never snapping.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The company’s ability to innovate branched out into its network of suppliers. And all this collective brain power was bonded together by Martin van den Brink. Everyone that enters the world of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is astonished by the confrontational culture he created. But as they often say in Veldhoven, there is ‘no shine without friction’. Consequently, a self-selecting mechanism emerged: if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Without Martin at the table, nothing is happening,’ one <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> manager concluded. But that dependency on one charismatic jack-of-all-trades has its risks. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is growing fast, so the company needs a new style of leadership. In truth, Van den Brink never really led a big company. He guided it like a start-up, as if it were a defiant toddler in the body of a mature multinational. This could have been a recipe for disaster, if not for its unique dual leadership. And so entered Peter Wennink, the chartered accountant with the ability to judge when to take control, and when to step back. He built an organization that tempered Van den Brink’s tantrums, without taming him.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A new season has begun at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, and it’s up to the supervisory board to choose the leadership. In 2023, the Dane Nils Andersen took on the duties of chairman. The nomination was intended as a display of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s European credentials. In Europe, the Danish are about as close to the Dutch as you can get. And having previously been a supervisor at Unilever and AkzoNobel, Andersen is well-versed in the corporate culture in the Netherlands.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In late 2023, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> selected Christophe Fouquet to succeed Wennink and Van den Brink, both of whom are retiring at the end of April 2024. Although the Frenchman Fouquet has lived and worked in the Netherlands for fifteen years, maintaining the company’s independent and spirited culture under his leadership will be a challenge. Eric Meurice’s experience as chief executive is still fresh in everyone’s mind. As a self-proclaimed admirer of Napoleon, the lack of obedience in Veldhoven struck one too many nerves.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This comes with an additional risk. The Dutch leadership has always been attached to the region around Veldhoven, whereas a top executive from another country might not have an issue moving parts of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> elsewhere should they no longer fit in Brabant. As <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s growth explodes beyond all borders, this has become an urgent topic. In November of 2023, several ministries in The Hague form an interdepartmental group to accommodate <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s national expansion. They did not forget to come up with a codename – ‘Beethoven’ – for a plan to invest an extra 2,5 billion euros to make the Netherlands a more attractive place for tech companies.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With Roger Dassen as the sole Dutch board member, the top leadership is more international than ever. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s culture is a global mix of talent, much like the powerful Bordeaux blends Peter Wennink is so fond of. If the connoisseur were to describe it, he would label it 40 percent European social capitalism, 40 percent Asian discipline, and 20 percent American free spirit. This unique character weaves together stakeholder values and a focus on innovation and freedom of thought, all home-grown in a country that embraces world trade, and imbued with more than a touch of Dutch directness.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In a way, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has an archaic Dutch style. At the same time, its size is not at all typical for the Dutch. White containers with blue logos are piling up in all corners of the world, while the management invests billions and rakes in orders that other big companies can only dream of, all without blinking an eye. These deals remain largely unknown outside the insular world of chip manufacturing, and rarely make headlines. This relative obscurity comes with the territory: the market leader in lithography only has a handful of customers, and does not sell products to consumers. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> doesn’t mind. It is fully convinced of its own potential, and any outside interference is noise it can do without.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Knowing all this, one could be surprised that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was willing to open its doors for the writing of this book. However, there was a reason for telling this story. For a long time, the company did not receive the political and social recognition for the unusual work it does. Chip technology was considered too difficult and too complicated. It never dawned on the politicians to ask whether the Netherlands, a country heavily reliant on trade and services, should perhaps be more interested in the well-being of its manufacturing industry. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> often felt invisible to the national government in The Hague, yet it needed federal support to avoid outgrowing what it could handle, placing an unbearable burden on the local environment, or being squashed between rival superpowers. Even though a tech giant had emerged in the Dutch province of Brabant, these attitudes made them an underdog on the national stage.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Only when the world woke up to the importance of chips did it become clear how dependent the global economy is on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Holding a dominant position in the semiconductor market bears a huge responsibility, which is why the quasi-monopolist imposed strict rules on itself: treat large and small chip manufacturers equally, and don’t overcharge them.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin van den Brink was hell-bent on staying modest and humble. He knew that abusing the company’s monopoly would be its downfall – which is why <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s agreement to restrict sales to Chinese customers was so out of character. The Dutch chip machines are intended to serve a global market and enable technological advancement for the common good. Making a profit is a side effect, not a goal.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This perspective fits <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s view on the world. Chips are defined as weapons in the tech war, but Veldhoven sees things differently. In their opinion, technology is non-political. It is a way to connect the world, to make it better, cleaner, healthier and more efficient. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> presents itself as a neutral public utility company that supplies all chip manufacturers. It’s not an odd comparison, according to Peter Wennink. ‘But unfortunately, such public utilities are often strictly regulated. So who would regulate us? The Netherlands? Europe? The world?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For now, America sets the rules. That is a bitter pill to swallow in Brabant. In retrospect, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s rise coincided with a period of favorable geopolitical conditions. After the Iron Curtain fell in 1989, Western capitalism seemed to be the sole viable economic system. Only economic logic and industrial ingenuity determined who could produce the best chips and the equipment to manufacture them. But when Xi Jinping’s China challenged the established dominance of the United States, the geopolitical lines returned in full force. The Cold War had the Iron Curtain – now, the tech war has a ‘Silicon Curtain’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">If Xi is to be believed, American democracy is in decline, while China offers the more viable alternative for the future. For their part, the Americans are approaching China’s technological rise much like the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction: curbing China’s chip development and production, and where possible, reversing it. The battle for technological supremacy is heating up, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is stuck in the middle.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This continual threat is reconfiguring the global landscape. To mitigate the risk of export restrictions, American suppliers of advanced chipmaking equipment are diversifying their production and research to countries like Singapore. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is also considering duplicating part of its Wilton and San Diego production elsewhere, which would allow them to continue supplying all customers. It may not be an efficient move, but that’s the way the world is headed.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">While supply chains fall apart, new policies are emerging. The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> are increasing their scrutiny of foreign investments in sensitive Chinese technology, while the Netherlands plan on screening technology students from China. This hits <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> where it hurts the most: capital and know-how. It is forced to treat its workers differently based on their nationalities, while it desperately needs all the tech talent those 144 countries can offer to keep up the pace of innovation.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">After the Dutch export measures against China were announced, Peter Wennink and Roger Dassen held a post-mortem to analyze the negotiations about the <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> machines. They found it hard to digest that there was no clear figure in government tasked with protecting the national high-tech industry. On paper, Mark Rutte – the prime minister whose fourth cabinet collapsed in July 2023 – was responsible. But Rutte shifted accountability to his ministers, who in turn leaned on their officials’ liabilities. Responsibilities were spread between offices and passed around like a hot potato. At the end of it all, no one could be held accountable.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The rules of the game are diffuse. This is what makes politics elusive, especially in the eyes of a company used to handling matters with atomic precision.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> became a trump card for the Dutch government, allowing it to remain relevant and visible on the world stage when multinationals like Shell and Unilever had already left the country. Right before Rutte finally received his invitation from Joe Biden in January of 2023, the Dutch prime minister described the Netherlands as a ‘world player in chip technology that could face the United States as an equal and with confidence’. In truth, that bordered on overconfidence. Having the whiz kids in Veldhoven in your back pocket makes you look like a superpower in the tech arena, but on the diplomatic stage, the Netherlands is dwarfed by the major players. You can count Rutte’s own team of geopolitical advisers on one hand, while the Americans have dozens of hardened specialists working in their departments and the National Security Council. In addition, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> economy is about twenty times bigger than the Dutch economy. The Netherlands is too small to protect its own tech giant from the political forces at play, and it failed to bring together its European partners for additional support.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With that in mind, it should not have been a surprise to the negotiators in The Hague that America decided to strong-arm the Netherlands. On October 17, 2023, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> announced unilateral measures to ‘close loopholes’ and slow down the Chinese chip industry. These export rules are aimed at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> machines that can align chip layers with an accuracy of 2.4 nanometers – while the Netherlands set the limit at 1.5 nanometers. These restrictions target advanced factories, hindering China’s progress in chip technology by approximately five generations.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With each move, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> is taking back control of the lithography technology it willingly parted with twenty years ago. The lowering of the de minimis norm from 25 to 0 percent is the perfect leverage to bend companies to their will. As a result, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needs a stamp of approval from Washington to send those machines to China. And the Americans keep on pushing the Dutch government to stop <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> from servicing its equipment in Chinese fabs.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">With Europe divided about the war between Israel and Hamas, diplomatic outrage about these measures has been restrained. While <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> countries bicker, American aircraft carriers are cruising towards the coast of Israel. Again, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> is showcasing the importance of its military power, just as when they provided military aid after the Russian invasion in Ukraine. Executing control over <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s exports to China seems to be a bargaining chip; an insurance fee the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> must pay to guarantee protection from the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Peter Wennink may have called <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> ‘just an influencer’, but it has undoubtedly become more than that. It is the spider to the Chips Act’s web, a powerful industrial player that can shape a European answer to America’s high-tech imperialism and China’s drive to expand. Such a stance would need to be focused on the long term, as Wennink hastens to add. Just like how South Korea is aiming to take over Taiwan’s position as most important chip center of the world. President Yoon even learned Veldhoven’s product brochure by heart, much to Wennink’s surprise. Despite this, the Netherlands still tends to underestimate the importance of its technology sector. The Dutch are ‘fat, dumb and happy’, as Wennink once sneered during a speech in Eindhoven.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">During a state visit to the Netherlands in April of 2023, French president Emmanuel Macron insisted on a one-on-one with Wennink. He had just stepped off the plane from his visit to China, where he met with Xi Jinping. Afterwards, he told <span class="fft-cursief">Politico</span> that Europe needs to become a strong world player and should not get entangled in any conflict over Taiwan. It was a political hand grenade, not unlike the ones the French president had occasionally thrown before.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the Science Park of the University of Amsterdam, Macron and Wennink discussed geopolitics and Taiwan for nearly 45 minutes. The French were astonished at how easily the Netherlands gave in to the pressure from the Americans to restrict <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. They would never do such a thing – supposedly. For his part, Wennink found Macron and other French politicians to be serious about the need for a strong European high-tech industry, with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> as its driving force. Finally, someone was listening.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Netherlands proved to be a loyal transatlantic ally, but it could have positioned itself differently had it received diplomatic backup from more powerful <span class="fft-kk">EU </span>countries. However, <a id="_idTextAnchor081" class="calibre3"></a>as long as export controls remain a matter of national concern, any <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> member state will likely prioritize its own interests.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The French will not give up control over their own affairs. They sell too many weapons for that. Germany also avoids any economic damage from any export restrictions – as long as <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> keeps running at full speed. But it is also struggling with its own relationship with China, and these kinds of national blinders prevent the member states from acknowledging the overarching value of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. As a result, Europe is punching well below its weight in the technology war.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The image of the future that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> projects is of a world that will forever need more chips, with increasingly smaller parts. This brings up an existential question: how much longer will the chip industry continue to lean on this one company’s technical innovations? As long as the economic machine keeps humming, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s lead seems too big to beat. Just like a rocket that, after propelling itself at a speed of 40,000 km per hour to escape gravity, no longer experiences any resistance.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Veldhoven has feelers in all the big chip factories in the world. This network of thousands of ‘learning’ machines collects huge amounts of data to improve production. This make <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s ecosystem indispensable to the entire industry. But for how long?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is possible that a new technology or a more affordable competitor could arise. For example, Canon makes machines that pattern chip surfaces using nano-imprint lithography, the commercial value of which remains unproven. On the other hand, Chinese companies have achieved significant market share in solar panels, telecommunication networks, batteries and electric vehicles, and could also become major competitors in the chipmaking equipment market. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> takes this seriously. Their go-to response: ‘The laws of nature are the same anywhere.’ What was achieved in Brabant, could be achieved in Bejing.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For now, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is Europe’s killer app – a tool the whole world needs. This means the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> has a vested interest in protecting their home-grown champion from unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft, and sorting out the dire lack of talented engineers it needs for its future growth. Assuring the continuity of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is a shared responsibility, as it has been in the past. Without its partners in Germany, Belgium and France, and without the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span>’s stimulus projects, the high-tech fairytale in Veldhoven never would have happened.</p>
