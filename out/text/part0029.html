			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Dawn breaks, but Vincent Nguyen is already wide awake. Standing at the foot of his bed, the young blogger runs through his equipment one last time. ‘Two extra batteries for my mobile phone and three for my video camera.’ Nguyen suspects he’ll need them. If the rumors are true, he won’t want to miss a second.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It’s Tuesday January 9, 2007, and after months of anticipation the presentation of Apple’s latest gadget is about to go live. Word is they’ve invented a device that can do it all: call, email, music, videos – everything. And now, at MacWorld 2007 in San Francisco, the wait is finally over. Nguyen slips into line at the Moscone center, that snakes its way up to the entrance on the first floor. It has all come down to this. Behind those doors, history awaits.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The floodgates open. Vincent sprints into the hall, closely followed by thousands of other visitors. Nguyen knows he has to act fast to claim the best spot. By now Apple is more like a cult than a computer maker, and everyone wants a close view of the company’s enigmatic leader. The hall is buzzing with anticipation. It’s electric. Steve Jobs steps out to a standing ovation, sporting his trademark jeans and black turtleneck. The founder, <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>, and front man lives for these moments. He is the undisputed king of product presentation, and this is his stage.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For the first time, the iPhone appears on the big screen. The audience is ecstatic. With the entire crowd hanging on his every word, Jobs turns on the charm. This is no old-fashioned telephone with cumbersome buttons and ‘baby software’, he says. This is a fully-fledged computer. Who needs more than one button – we have a touch screen that can do the rest. Magic, all in the palm of your hand.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">An astounded ‘whoa’ resonates as the Apple Boss opens the slide to unlock screen. A smattering of stunned laughter and applause sweeps across the hall. No one can believe what they’re seeing. With one swipe of his finger, Jobs has opened the door to the future.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">He smirks. ‘Wanna see that again?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Six months later and on the other side of the country, a long line has formed at the Apple store in New York. It’s June 29, 2007, otherwise known as release day, and Vincent Nguyen is once again right at the front of the line. He is one of the first to come running and cheering out of the store, a black bag raised triumphantly in his right hand. Apple employees form a guard of honor, applauding as he steps out into the sea of cameras. The photo of Vincent with his iPhone is beamed across the world: the ultimate recognition for the most loyal of followers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The introduction of the iPhone marked the start of a revolution in mobile technology that would irrevocably alter daily life. When Google followed in Apple’s footsteps and released the mobile operating system Android, the phone cemented its place as the most important computer in the lives of millions of people. Soon there was an app for everything, and pockets gradually got lighter as every accessory to our lives was integrated into the one device: ID’s, tickets, bank cards; even your entire social life was now at your fingertips. As soon as billions of eyeballs caught sight of those screens that fateful day in 2007, they never really looked away.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The revolution that began with the iPhone also changed the chip industry. The smartphone is itself a ‘killer app’, an indispensable tool that demands ever increasing memory, processing power, and sensors. The need for continuous internet connection led to more capable modem-chips, which in turn opened the door to an unprecedented explosion of data, even faster mobile networks and the ubiquity of cloud services. Thanks to your phone, offline is no longer an option.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2006 Intel, who was supplying the chips for Apple’s computers, was asked if it could also supply the processor for the iPhone. It declined: the margins in mobile chips were far too small for such a company. This was a blunder of historic proportions. Considering there are now 1.5 billion iPhones in circulation, with the latest device costing somewhere around a thousand dollars, Intel shot themselves in the foot.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The first iPhone received a chip based on <span class="fft-kk">ARM</span> technology. Although more efficient with its power than the processor in a PC, you would still be lucky if your phone made it to the end of the day without an extra charge – and there’s no magic in lumping a dead block of aluminum around in your pocket. The battery life needed to be extended, so Apple decided it would design its own chips. As Jobs preached, you can’t have good software without its own dedicated hardware. In 2008, he acquired the chip company <span class="fft-kk">PA</span> Semi, and Apple developed its first chips for the iPad and iPhone. The strategy worked, and since 2020 Apple Silicon has been so fast that the company now uses their own chips in laptops and computers. With a battery life that dwarfs its predecessors, the MacBook no longer needs Intel to stand on its own two feet.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Apple also profited heavily from <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s new production techniques, as the Taiwanese manufacturer became the first to figure out how to create chip structures using 5-nanometer technology. If you’re wondering how small that is, look at your hand and count to five. Your fingernail grows at a rate of one nanometer – one millionth of a millimeter – per second. Whatever you did – or didn’t – see is what <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> needs to work with.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Although the circuits on the chip are actually farther apart, there’s still only one machine in the entire world that can manufacture <a id="_idTextAnchor022" class="calibre3"></a>these ultrathin lines. Apple knows all about this, because in 2010 the headquarters in Cupertino were repeatedly visited by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s engineers. There, they explained the physics-defying machine currently under construction in Veldhoven: a machine capable of delivering an even more powerful engine for the iPhones of the future.</p>
