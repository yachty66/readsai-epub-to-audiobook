			<p class="ff-platmetwit">If you close your eyes, you can hardly tell which of them is talking. A Brabant accent, a little sonorous, not a word more than needed. One thing is clear though: they are a pair of no-nonsense entrepreneurs.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wim and Willem van der Leegte are sitting side by side in the Eindhoven headquarters of the <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> group. The family of this father-son duo built the largest industrial conglomerate in the Netherlands. Their one hundred companies represent the entire spectrum of the manufacturing industry: whether you need mega-construction or nanometer precision, they’ve got you covered.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> family tree spans three generations. The company was founded in 1953 by Pieter van der Leegte. His son Wim soon took the reins, and in 2018 his grandson Willem became <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>, supported by his sister and brother. The Van der Leegtes watched from the other side of the highway as <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> began to expand dramatically. And sure enough, they jumped on board for the ride.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘The circle is complete,’ declared Wim van der Leegte when he bought the Enabling Technologies Group from Philips in 2006. He always had a feel for history. Back in the early 1950s, his own father used to work at <span class="fft-kk">ETG</span>, during the time when its full name ‘Philips Machine Factory’ was still written in clear letters across the façade. Van der Leegte paid Philips 51 million euros for <span class="fft-kk">ETG</span>. In hindsight, he realized this was an excellent deal. The family rode the waves of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s successes, which helped propel the business to more than 15,000 employees and nearly 6 billion euros in annual revenue. In 2015, Wim also acquired his brother Gerard van der Leegte’s company, <span class="fft-kk">GL</span> Precision. Just to keep the family together, as you do in Brabant.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Together with Zeiss, <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> holds the title of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s most important partner. They supply Veldhoven with critical building blocks needed to assemble a functional scanner. The newer machines are comprised of more than three hundred thousand parts from around seven hundred suppliers, and this external network accounts for around 80 percent of the total manufacturing costs of a lithography machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One glance at the <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> <span class="fft-kk">ETG</span> factories in Almelo tells the story of the transformation undergone by the Dutch manufacturing industry. You can still find moss-green Philips machines from the 1970s dotted between the state-of-the-art laser equipment, like relics from a bygone era. As long as they work, they aren’t going anywhere.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In Almelo, the company produces the underside of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s lithography machines. What starts as a twenty-ton block of Italian aluminum ends up as a meticulously milled fifteen-hundred kilogram frame. Like filing down a city bus until you are left with a Mini Cooper.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The frame is filled with heavy magnets – if you get caught near it with anything metallic in or on your body, you will be stuck there forever. This force is needed to drive the electric motors that move the wafer tables back and forth in the machine, just like a magnetic levitation train.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The vacuum chambers for <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines are also produced in Almelo, as well as the modules that Zeiss mounts the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> mirrors in. These components have to meet incredibly strict requirements, to the point that employees are only allowed into the cleanroom if they use the prescribed shampoo and deodorant. For Zeiss, any stray molecule from Almelo is one too many.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As a billion-dollar company, <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> has been able to handle the ups and downs in the chip industry. The industrial conglomerate has plenty of other customers in need of advanced technology, so <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> can recoup the investments that are required for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. ‘Due to the high standards set by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, we have had to step up ourselves,’ Willem van der Leegte explains. His company even took one additional step: <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> has full responsibility for one component of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s machine. The so-called “wafer handler” is a robotic arm that lays the silicon wafers precisely where they need to be on the wafer table, ready to be exposed to the world of nanometers. The design and maintenance is handled by <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> itself, and it ensures that other companies supply the necessary parts. This leaves <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> with one less issue to worry about. The machine is complicated enough – if someone else can do something better, it is gladly left to them.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Like all other suppliers, <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> must keep up with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s growth. This means recruiting new technicians and developers, investing in new buildings, and setting up emergency cleanrooms to expand capacity. However, not every party in the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> chain can accelerate at the same pace, or even wants to. For smaller suppliers, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is a customer they both desire and fear. The demands this erratic buyer places on these companies are as daunting as the heights it can propel them to. Veldhoven has strict guidelines, and suppliers can only use products sourced from companies selected by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> itself. There is no room for substituting the prescribed ingredients – anything that could lead to disruption in the chip factory needs to be eliminated.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The company continues to raise the bar. Each year, suppliers are required to work more precisely, more cleanly, and offer better value for money. Every fingerprint is one too many. Even the rubber anti-slip layer on the ear grips of your glasses could be a problem, as it can emit gases capable of damaging the delicate <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> mirrors.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is not only demanding; it is unpredictable. In periods of growth, there is never enough speed and capacity in the supply chain. But as soon as orders decline, everything becomes too much, and suppliers are left with an abundance of capital-intensive goods. And it is never easy to stay afloat while carrying that much weight. Smaller companies also risk pricing themselves out of the market when investing in high-value production methods for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, as they might then become too expensive for other customers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To limit the risks, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> insists that its suppliers get a maximum of 40 percent of their revenue from Veldhoven. This guideline is intended to keep companies from collapsing during a downturn in the chip industry. However, when faced with the chip market’s unrestrained growth and the floods of orders that come with it, keeping to that percentage is easier said than done. In these cases, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s response is usually the same: just figure it out.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The sourcing and procurement team keeps meticulous records of companies that are causing delays. If you land on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s ‘Top 5 List’, you have a serious problem. Whenever a supplier is becoming problematic, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> sends in reinforcements to help smooth things over. And it does not hesitate to call the shots. For example, when a Dutch supplier was struggling with a capacity issue – a necessary production tool was not available in Europe – <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> immediately ensured that the equipment was flown over from the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. No ifs, ands or buts. Fronting tens of thousands of euros in transportation costs is worth every penny when it saves a few weeks of delivery time.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Every supplier has its own ‘godfather’ within <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s organization. However, if there are serious problems, a higher power will intervene. In 2021, when a supplier failed to resolve a recurring issue with a critical mechatronics component, Peter Wennink insisted the company should change its management. And there was no room for discussion, according to the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>: ‘The investigation work had already been done by our team of experts. And I’m the judge that delivers the verdict.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Sometimes <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> will help out its suppliers with an injection of capital, just like it did for Zeiss when it needed support for High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span>. The last resort would be an acquisition, which happened with Cymer when that American company was unable to get the light source for the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine to work. On a slightly smaller scale, in 2012 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> acquired Wijdeven Motion, a company with ninety employees that supplies linear motors and was on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The supplier Berliner Glas also failed to keep up with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s demands. This German family-owned company with 1600 employees makes the super-flat mirrors on which the wafers are placed. In 2020, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> demanded that Berliner Glas make an investment of 70 million euros for the next generation of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. The Germans were not interested, so <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> bought the company to speed things up. If they needed to do it themselves, they would. You could see the effects at the Berlin location within a year. Berliner Glas was renamed <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> Berlin, surplus business units were sold off, new construction had already been completed, and leases for additional offices had been signed. And the cautiousness of the Germans had been thrown out the window.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘We don’t <span class="fft-cursief">make</span> anything here,’ claims Martin van den Brink. It’s a slight exaggeration, but his point is clear: <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> only assembles the lithography machines, and the wide range of suppliers take care of providing the parts. This model has been essential to keeping everything moving. It granted <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> a remarkable ability to recover in the first decades of its existence, while its vertically integrated Japanese competitors were still stuck making most of the components themselves. Just like a lightweight boxer can bounce back to their feet faster than a heavyweight.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span> avoids taking on more suppliers to maintain this flexibility. All suppliers have their own responsibilities, to encourage them to regain the high-tech investments they make for Veldhoven from other customers. This is also why the company turned down Wim van der Leegte’s informal offer in 2006 to jointly acquire <span class="fft-kk">ETG</span> fifty-fifty.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">While the oversight and management for the lithography system as a whole lies with Veldhoven, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> tries to spread these responsibilities further across the network. Because the most complex components of the machine are single-sourced – there’s only one supplier for these crucial parts – a high level of trust is essential. This approach differs from conventional sourcing strategies, which typically pit suppliers against each other to drive down costs and mitigate risk. But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s model has an advantage. The suppliers effectively become co-developers of the machine, and their deep involvement in the material means they are also able to solve problems they are not the cause of themselves.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When Frédéric Schneider became chief operating officer in 2010, he was surprised that Veldhoven was so willing to tie its fate to the success of a handful of companies. Schneider wanted to seek out a backup supplier for all the sensitive parts of the machine, but the board of directors decided to stick to the principle of single sourcing and mutual dependency. Throughout the entire chip industry, the most reliable relationships are built with just one trusted partner. Frits van Hout has an analogy: ‘Think how your spouse might react if you were to have an equally deep relationship with somebody else.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Chip manufacturers also entrust their fate to a few crucial, highly specialized and non-interchangeable suppliers. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is the case in point: its monopoly over lithography machines makes it notoriously irreplaceable. The semiconductor sector is made up of deep but fragile connections, like an incredibly valuable yet brittle chain.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, in December of 2018, the dangers of single sourcing become apparent. A fire breaks out at Prodrive, a tech company based in Son, a town close to Veldhoven. Prodrive is responsible for supplying the control system for the motors of lithography machines – in practice, this means software that runs on large data racks. And in one night, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s sole source of this component goes up in a cloud of smoke.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Prodrive’s first call goes to the fire department, and the second straight to Veldhoven. The same day, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> sends a crisis team to assess the damage. Their IT systems were no longer functioning, so <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> immediately provides fifty heavy-duty computers. Even before the insurance company has assessed the damage, employees have already salvaged usable equipment from the smoldering factory. Other suppliers also <a id="_idTextAnchor061" class="calibre3"></a>help out, although this is not entirely altruistic. If <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is unable to deliver machines, everyone suffers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This would not be the last time <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> played firefighter. When <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> falls victim to a cyberattack in October 2021, the IT experts from Veldhoven are immediately on the scene. There is little to be done, and <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> has no choice but to pull the plug on all the computers to smoke out the hackers. It takes a month to get all IT systems up and running again.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, the biggest threat to the supply chain comes from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> itself. The company completely underestimated the growth of the chip industry, which meant that the sudden escalation in demand during the pandemic also caught suppliers off guard. They were overwhelmed by the relentless stream of increases and changes from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, which were sometimes happening twenty or thirty times per week. In hindsight, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> admits that their updates could have been better. This is a huge understatement about the demand the suppliers faced. In addition, the <span class="fft-kk">COVID</span>-19 crisis disrupted their own supply chains, as the machines they needed to make components for new chip machines were in turn waiting for chips. It was a vicious circle of scarcity.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> became locked in a continuous battle to resolve these bottlenecks, like a traffic cop at a busy intersection full of honking cars. Which component is most urgent? Who has been stuck waiting the longest? Who gets priority?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To make things even more complicated, different departments in Veldhoven put pressure on the suppliers at the same time. The factory and the developers often get in each other’s way, like two dogs fighting over the same bone. Technical drawings sometimes contradict each other, as different teams have been working on them at the same time to rush things through. Suppliers can also tell when they are dealing with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s new hires brought in to handle the rapid growth. Although well-versed in technical theory, many of the rookies lack practical expertise and struggle to navigate the maze of abbreviations.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> acknowledges the teams in Veldhoven are wrestling with the extreme expansion. ‘When you hire such a large amount of people in a short time, it’s difficult to preserve the culture of your company,’ says Willem van der Leegte. He concludes <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> is in the same boat: ‘Their problems affect us. That’s part of our mutual dependence. It’s win-win or lose-lose.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">From the outside, it seemed <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was unable to handle the surging demand for chip machines because of their struggling suppliers. As a result, investors complained about <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s shortcomings in its supply chain management. Little did they know that there was something else going on. Right in the middle of the most hectic year in the company’s history, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had suffered an acute heart attack.</p>
