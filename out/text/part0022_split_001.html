			<p class="ff-platmetwit">On Tuesday, October 16, 2001, one month after the attack on the Twin Towers in New York City, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> declared a state of emergency. The press release got straight to the point: ‘As a result of the ongoing crisis in the semiconductor industry, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> Holding NV announces that it will cut 23 percent of its global workforce, amounting to 2000 workers in total.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The timing was poor, but they had their reasons. Doug Dunn had just acquired an American competitor, Silicon Valley Group (<span class="fft-kk">SVG</span>). With <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> on board, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s workforce doubled overnight to around eight thousand employees. But almost a quarter of these workers needed to go. Dunn had set his sights on attracting Intel, the last remaining large client of <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span>. He saw the move as <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s quickest way to market leadership, provided the American president was on board. For the first time, Veldhoven was about to be subject to the whims of world politics.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Dunn had met Intel <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> Craig Barrett at a fundraiser in 2000 for then American presidential candidate George W. Bush. While Bush was busy preaching his ‘conservatism with compassion’ to the voters, Barrett disclosed to Dunn that Intel was facing a problem. The chip manufacturer was being supplied by both Nikon and <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> and was using machines from both lithography companies in their factories. Yet the success of Taiwanese chip manufacturer <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s equipment had not passed him by. With promising new technology from <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> failing to get off the ground, Barrett had made up his mind. He wanted to try out the Dutch machines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, Intel was under pressure to keep <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> alive. Their collapse would cause an acute problem for Intel’s factories, which actively ran about two hundred of their machines. Furthermore, this would mean the end of the last remnant of American-owned lithography technology, already a sensitive matter in Washington. The superpower would not want to relinquish the ability to produce chips on home soil with homegrown equipment.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Barrett saw the solution standing in front him: Doug Dunn. He knew <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was already in talks with <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span>, so the Intel <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> encouraged Dunn to buy the company. American lithography technology would at least remain in Western hands, and Intel could make use of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s machines while also guaranteeing the continuity of the existing machines. In turn, the Dutch company would finally achieve its dream and leap to market leader. It was a win-win-win situation.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In October 2000, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> announced the takeover of the Silicon Valley Group to the tune of 1.6 billion dollars, paid with stock. However, the deal could only proceed if the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (<span class="fft-kk">CFIUS</span>) granted approval. This was the body responsible for assessing the threat foreign companies posed if they acquired crucial American technology. And so <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> came head-to-head with the policymakers in Washington, the city where economic logic competes with national security. It’s hard to call the winner in matchups like this. As Doug Dunn puts it: ‘There’s reality, and there’s politics.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Relaxing in his vacation home in Spain towards the end of 2000, Dunn heard the phone ring. He had been summoned. That Monday he would need to be at the Pentagon, where <span class="fft-kk">CFIUS</span> would be holding a meeting at the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Department of Defense in a small room on the second floor. Dunn just about made it, immediately apologizing to the committee members as he walked in the door. He had come directly from his flight, and with no time to change he was still dressed in his vacation outfit.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The discussions with <span class="fft-kk">CFIUS</span> were conducted together with Peter Wennink. Given the political reactions unleashed by the <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> acquisition, the committee at the Pentagon pulled the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> representatives through the wringer and back. It was now Dunn’s turn to be on the other side of the table.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> was comprised of multiple companies, each requiring their own in-depth assessment and posing potential challenges. A stumbling block proved to be Tinsley Laboratories, an operation that polished lenses for military applications and espionage satellites. And there was another challenge; <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> held the license for a relatively undeveloped lithography technique, utilizing light with a much tighter wavelength – known as extreme ultraviolet light, or <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> for short.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Having caught wind of proceedings, a group of lobbyists converged to urge the government agencies that it was a matter of national security to keep <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> American. Opposing them was the lobby from Intel and the semi-conductor industry association SIA. They claimed that the acquisition was necessary to advance lithography technology, which was squarely in America’s interest.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">CFIUS</span> case ended up lasting months, with opponents of the deal going to great lengths to discredit <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. No secrets were safe: any skeletons tucked away were prized out and thrust into the spotlight. Chairman of the supervisory board Henk Bodt found himself in a tough spot. He also served as a board member of Delft Instruments, a company that had supplied banned night vision equipment to Iraq during the first Gulf War. However, he came through unscathed: this was some years before Bodt actually joined Delft Instruments.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One of the parties opposing the acquisition was Ultratech, a competitor embroiled in a patent dispute with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. But by far the most outspoken opponent was a man by the name of Edward Dohring, the former <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> of <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span>. He feared that America was losing essential lithography technology, and that countries hostile to the States would be able to build significantly faster chips if they gained access to it. In April of 2001, with YouTube still a distant dream,<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> congress members got a videotape in their mailboxes. The title left little room for interpretation: <span class="fft-cursief">‘Why the Sale of </span><span class="fft-kk">SVG</span><span class="fft-cursief"> Co. is bad for the United States.’</span> Six hundred and fifty copies of the tape found their way to the Pentagon and the Department of Commerce. Even George W. Bush, freshly inaugurated as the 43<sup class="fft-superscript">rd</sup> president of the United States, received a copy. After all, he carried the final word on the <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> acquisition. Bush demanded an extra two weeks. This would take some consideration.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Meanwhile The Hague was growing impatient. With the Cold War over and globalization firmly on the rise, they were at a loss as to why the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> was causing such a great fuss over what was in their eyes a simple acquisition. Exasperated, Minister of Economic Affairs Annemarie Jorritsma cornered the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> ambassador, insisting on a swift resolution. ‘She firmly stated her annoyance,’ was the report from her spokesperson in the national newspaper <span class="fft-kk">NRC</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Looking back, Doug Dunn can only scoff: ‘No one puts pressure on the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. As soon as they say it’s a matter of national security, it’s game over.’ Nothing any Dutch politician could say would carry any weight, least of all cause George Bush to change his mind.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The acquisition was approved in late May 2001. That was not due to Jorritsma’s discontent, nor an act of compassion from Bush. What sealed the deal was the backing of Intel: their strong links with the United States Department of Defense had given it the push that was needed. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> complied with the requests of <span class="fft-kk">CFIUS</span> and sold the parts considered too sensitive in the American’s eyes, including Tinsley Laboratories.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Once more, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had found itself on the receiving end of what amounted to interrogations. The <span class="fft-kk">CFIUS</span> talks were highly intense cross-examinations: fifteen experts from all the relevant<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> ministries would spend hours bombarding Dunn and Wennink with questions. After the second meeting Dunn was so disoriented he walked straight out without stopping to pick up his leather winter coat from the Pentagon cloakroom, only realizing in the car on the way to the airport. Sheepishly, he called the Pentagon to ask if they could send him his coat.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But the wheels of<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> bureaucracy are slow to turn. Close to two years later, just before he resigned from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, a package arrived. Inside was his leather coat, along with a greeting from the Pentagon. An unexpected souvenir from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s encounter with the hornet’s nest in Washington. ‘It was probably bugged,’ Dunn grins.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span> had managed to secure Intel as a customer via <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span>. However, the delay in Washington meant the deal was closed amid the dot-com crisis. The stock price halved within a year, as did the revenue, and investors were demanding measures be taken. By the end of 2001, around 1100 employees had lost their jobs. Many <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers couldn’t understand why they had burdened themselves with <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span>, especially in the middle of a crisis. The takeover had only sped up the inevitable: it had become a matter of when not if Intel would make the switch to Veldhoven. In their eyes, Dunn had caused unnecessary misery by obtaining a dying competitor that made exclusively ‘old crap’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Across the pond, there were just as many doubts among the new American employees. Who did these Dutch think they were to swan in like this? And where on earth is Veldhoven?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> had a branch in Wilton, a village typical of small-town America nestled in the woods of Connecticut. Although unassuming, important chapters in the history of lithography were written in this town. Wilton was once home to PerkinElmer, the company interested in Philips’ wafer-steppers in the early 1980s. It had been manufacturing advanced lenses as far back as the Second World War, and in the late ’60s was commissioned by the Department of Defense to design lithography machines that would produce chips for military applications. They also made the lenses for the Hubble Space Telescope but had to pay millions when <span class="fft-kk">NASA</span> found out – after the launch – that the telescope was unable to focus properly and had to be upgraded. Eventually, they fell behind developments in lithography, and found themselves taken over by <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Doug Dunn had been entirely preoccupied with snagging Intel, believing that <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> had nothing special in-house that other companies could not offer as well. The extensive expertise in Wilton begged to differ. They crafted catadioptric lenses, made up of a complex combination of lenses and mirrors. They also built wafer-tracks, the machines that apply the light-sensitive layer to silicon discs.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was not at all interested. They wanted to remain a one trick pony, focusing all their efforts on producing the lithography machine, the most expensive piece of equipment in a chip factory. And so, in November 2001, large swathes of the technology at <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> were declared redundant and development was ordered to desist. This went down horribly in Wilton. ‘Something I had worked on for twenty years was suddenly worthless,’ recalled Christopher (‘call me Chip’) Mason. Mason had been a long-esteemed researcher at the company, frequently lauded for his pioneering work. Yet he suddenly felt totally superfluous. It would take years before he could finally get on board with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s approach.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To reconcile the bad blood between the employees in Wilton and Veldhoven, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> brought into production a full-color staff magazine: <span class="fft-cursief">Spectrum</span>. The second issue carried an interview with Martin van den Brink, who had since risen to be a member of the board of directors. He talked the usual talk about the need for speed and risk-taking in the chip industry, but Van den Brink knew he had other problems. He had to figure out how to forge one company from not only two lithography programs, but two groups of stubborn and bitter engineers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For the interview he posed with his horse on the cover, clad head-to-toe in Western attire. Action photos of him galloping past the camera adorned the inner pages. The message: there was a cowboy inside every <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’er, and Martin was already giving his one-trick pony the spurs.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The horse was named ‘Harry’, as was his previous owner – Martin liked to name his horses after the person he bought them from, for ease of memory. But the results of the photo shoot didn’t sit well with him. He felt these pictures of him and Harry placed him unjustly on a pedestal. People might get the wrong idea that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was all about him, or worse, that he thought himself the center of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s universe.</p>
