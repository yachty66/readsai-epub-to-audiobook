			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The chauffeur parks on the north side of the Pentagon. From here, you can gaze across the Potomac river and see the Washington Monument piercing the sky. On this side of the riverbank lies Arlington, Virgina, and the seat of the largest ministry in the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> – the Department of Defense.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Peter Wennink strolls to the VIP entrance. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s chief is there for an appointment with Heidi Shyu, the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is the summer of 2022, and the negotiations over the export restrictions for China are in full swing. Wennink has thirty minutes to explain to the Americans the dangers of coming down too hard on the Chinese chip industry. But Shyu is curious about other risks – could the Chinese not simply take apart and copy the machines <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> supplies?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Well, no, not really,’ Wennink replies. They tried, but <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s hardware only tells half the story. How to bring all those components together – that is where the real magic happens. Without the know-how of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s experts, the Chinese do not stand a chance of replicating the machines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And Shyu wants to know something else. She was born in Taiwan, the country that is losing chip specialists to the lure of enormous salaries in China. Is <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> not afraid of corporate espionage from the Chinese employees who make off with their technical knowledge?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This time, the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> could not say no.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The 2022 annual report tells the story. Earlier that year, a former employee in China absconds with trade secrets from Veldhoven. Although <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> does not confirm this publicly, the data is taken by someone who then goes to work for Huawei. Since the beginning of the tech war, the telecom giant has been focusing on the development of its own chip technology, and by the end of 2022, even receives a patent for something they called ‘<span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> lithography’. This does not prove Huawei can actually build such a machine, but it leaves no doubt about its ambitions.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The theft may have violated export rules, which means <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needs to disclose the event. The timing is terrible. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is forced to stand and confess just how vulnerable it is, right at the height of the negotiations over the export regulations. But the debacle has no tangible consequences, as Peter Wennink assures the investors during a meeting in Veldhoven. The stolen information was ‘only one piece of a huge jigsaw puzzle, that does not even have the box with its picture.’ Useless, in other words.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But this is not the first time <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> falls victim to industrial espionage, and it will certainly not be the last. Geopolitical tensions throw Veldhoven into the international spotlight and turn <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> into a prominent target. The company recorded 2,800 cyber incidents in 2022 alone, ranging from ransomware attacks to attempts to steal intellectual property. Hackers are coming from inside and outside, and they all have their sights set on a piece of the Veldhoven puzzle.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s knowledge is spread over a large number of different links, both internally and within the network of suppliers. The lithography machines are complex in every dimension – everything from design, production, and operation – which means there is no single blueprint for delivering a functioning machine. Not one single person knows everything there is to know about how these machines work. Not even Martin van den Brink, the commander-in-chief of lithography systems with forty years of experience under his belt.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Most engineers work on one small component and know everything there is to know about that piece of the puzzle. As Frits van Hout philosophically describes it: ‘The people who know how it should be done don’t know why it should be done. And the people who know why it should be done don’t know how it should be done.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Historically, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has invested minimal effort in protecting sensitive data. Drawings or other technical data used to be readily accessible, even if you were not working directly with them. You can still stumble upon scientific research online on how the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light source works. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> practices a culture of open innovation, cultivating a large knowledge network where information can be freely exchanged, whether at conferences, or with clients, partner companies or research institutes. Expertise <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> lacks in-house is quickly hauled in. As the engineers see it, every dam created in this free flow of information only slows down progress. And in this environment, there is no room for distrust. ‘I trust everyone who walks into my office out of principle,’ says Martin. ‘Otherwise, I can’t do my job.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is a hopeful attitude. But to the supervisory board, it is naïve. They endlessly warn <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> that the company needs to build a higher fence around its intellectual property. But you never learn until you make the mistake. The hack in 2015 is the trigger for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to drastically professionalize its IT security. After 2015, what was once a security team of ten grows to more than three hundred experts.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Ever since, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s security specialists have had the tough task of convincing their colleagues to take better care of the sensitive information in their hands. Not because of some bureaucratic red tape, but out of dire necessity. Residents from countries such as Iran and Syria are no longer allowed to work on some of the technology due to sanctions, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is required by law to shield certain information from them. Employees no longer have access to every part of the lithography machine – now, they can only request information about the parts closely connected to their piece of the puzzle. If you are an engineer working on wafer tables, you do not need to see what they are doing with tin droplets in San Diego, or with electron beams in Delft.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> also learns about internal data theft the hard way. In 2014, a group of Chinese employees from the Silicon Valley division jump ship with optimization software. The former employees launch the competing company Xtal, but are caught almost immediately.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">By far the best way to prevent malicious employees from stealing data is to weed them out before they step foot in the door. This is why Peter Baillière is shocked to find that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is not conducting pre-employment screenings when he takes up the role of director of <span class="fft-kk">HR</span> in 2018. Not a single background check is run on candidates who apply for positions with certain responsibilities. In 2021, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> relents. People in critical positions are now required to provide a certificate of good conduct, and for some jobs <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> even wants security investigations to be conducted by the Dutch intelligence service, the <span class="fft-kk">AIVD</span>. These investigations are similar to airport employees being screened in secure zones. But despite <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s repeated requests for these extra-stringent control measures, the Dutch government is unmoved. <span class="fft-kk">AIVD</span> just does not have the capacity to screen that many people.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> also tries to collaborate with foreign governments to screen new employees outside of the Netherlands. Since exploding onto the world stage, the number of applications to work at the tech company has increased to around three hundred thousand per year. ‘If only we were still obscure,’ sighs one <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’er. ‘Now we also attract a whole different type of person.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Dutch intelligence service has been warning for years about economic espionage targeting companies like <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, and the <span class="fft-kk">AIVD</span> has begun to advise people who travel to China with sensitive information to wipe clean or even destroy their equipment upon return. The managers at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> find this to be a hassle, and they are far laxer with their devices. Sometimes too much so, as one of the managers admits. In their eyes, there is nothing shocking to find on their laptops, except for some plans to sell more devices or emails from clients about malfunctioning machines. The intelligence services think otherwise. The <span class="fft-kk">AIVD</span> even occasionally uses traveling <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers as bait, just to see if China is secretly installing spyware on pre-prepared phones. Nothing suspicious is found, but still, it does not mean espionage is not happening.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As the sole supplier of the most complex machine in the world, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> assumes no other company is smart enough to bring together all the separate pieces of the puzzle. In the unlikely event that that would happen, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would likely wish you luck. The machine is far too complicated for an outsider to operate. It would be like letting a bad driver get behind the wheel of a Formula 1 car – you know they’ll crash at the first turn.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This boundless confidence in their own abilities comes across as naïve or arrogant to some outsiders. Intellectual property theft seems to have little effect in the short term, but the consequences are noticeable in the long run. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> takes a decidedly pragmatic approach to this. There is only one way to win the technological race – you <a id="_idTextAnchor075" class="calibre3"></a>have to run faster than your opponents. Do not gamble on the idea that your security will always be airtight, or that your patents will always be respected in China – <span class="fft-cursief">that </span>would be naïve. Industrial espionage comes with the territory, so count on everyone watching your every step. In the meantime, just try to make as much money as possible and invest that capital back into research to stay one step ahead. If you want to win against the competition, you <a id="_idTextAnchor076" class="calibre3"></a>have to ‘out-innovate them’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, the economic logic of this strategy increasingly gets undermined by the tech war. The more China is backed into a corner and cut off from advanced chip manufacturing, the less reservations it has about obtaining the missing pieces of the puzzle by any means. In addition, the Chinese government has allocated a seemingly unlimited budget to develop an independent national chip industry. It is difficult to win when your opponent’s pockets run that deep.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Chinese is the fourth most prevalent nationality at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, after Dutch, American and Taiwanese. Around 1,500 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers work in China, and around half of the employees in Silicon Valley are Chinese. Holding a Chinese passport precludes them from accessing all information or visiting some cleanrooms in Veldhoven, as this would violate the American export regulations. In turn, American employees are not allowed to work for Chinese chip companies.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">These differentiating lines are also evident in the institutions <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> collaborates with, like the technical universities and <span class="fft-kk">TNO</span>. The Dutch government is preparing a law which aims to prevent the leak via students of sensitive technological knowledge to countries such as China or Russia. Naturally, this includes research on semiconductors and chip machines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Occasionaly, the Dutch universities seek the help of the <span class="fft-kk">AIVD</span> to screen Chinese candidates wanting to conduct postdoctoral research. A blanket ban was instilled on students from the ‘Seven Sons of National Defense’, seven universities in China known to have ties to the Chinese military. Students from these institutions or their family members could be pressured to gather information for the Chinese government, and some have scholarships stipulating that they need to share the acquired knowledge. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is also scaling back its collaboration with these universities, but still offers tech talent from China access.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">While Chinese talent is irreplaceable, and discrimination based on nationality goes against <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s policies, the company cannot ignore geopolitical red lines. The <span class="fft-kk">ARCNL</span> institute, founded in collaboration with the University of Amsterdam, has several Chinese PhD candidates who conduct research on nanolithography who are now prohibited from attending some meetings with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Russia is a sensitive area: Veldhoven terminated its collaboration with the Russian scientific institute <span class="fft-kk">ISAN</span>, which assisted research into the plasma source for the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine. Located just south of Moscow, <span class="fft-kk">ISAN</span> housed a miniature version of the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light source the Russian plasma physicists conducted experiments with. Their contribution was crucial in getting <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> up and running, as was the work of the Russian researchers who relocated to Veldhoven.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘We’re inclusive, but no longer naïve,’ says Peter Baillière. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> also recognizes the danger within Veldhoven’s walls, and begins monitoring the behavior of employees on the network. Advanced detection software is installed, which triggers an alarm if someone suspiciously begins copying documents or emailing files to a private address. This monitoring works, and people occasionally have been intercepted attempting to siphon off files. And if you get caught, rest assured the response will be harsh. Just to send a message, as Baillière explains.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The last thing he wants to create is a culture of fear at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Employees need to be able to trust each other blindly: without trust, the vast majority of the work becomes impossible. Despite this, the security measures are becoming even stricter. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers in the factories and research labs now have to pass through a detection gate to prevent theft. The barriers have also been raised on the company network. You can no longer randomly download technical drawings from the inventory systems, and the Wikipedia-style site where engineers share practical tips has been moved to a stricter IT environment. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has also brought in heavy artillery to improve security in the chip factories, Sunny Stalnaker notes. ‘They’re overloading us with new rules we have to pay attention to. All incredibly important, but somehow we still need to find the time to get the work done.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Employees also receive training to recognize phishing attempts. Random invitation to a job interview in your mailbox? Tread carefully – these situations are precisely the moments when people end up talking extensively about the company they work for. Some of these interviews are entirely fake, designed only to elicit information.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In-field expertise is particularly susceptible to such phishing attempts. Engineers perfecting the chip machines in the fabs have extensive practical experience, and frequently come into contact with sensitive data from clients such as Intel, Samsung and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And this data is gold to the phishers, as the largest chip manufacturer, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, is almost hermetically sealed off from the outside world. ‘You can’t trust anyone,’ as the Taiwanese say. Their island is saturated with Chinese corporate spies, and there is a nationwide ‘zero trust’ cybersecurity policy. With good reason: between 2018 and 2020, a Chinese hacker group infiltrated more than seven chip companies in Hsinchu to steal chip designs.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is the same hacker group that went unnoticed for two years in the computer network of chip manufacturer <span class="fft-kk">NXP</span>, based just around the corner from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. The perpetrators targeted chip designs and stole mailboxes and other sources of sensitive information. When <span class="fft-kk">NXP</span> discovered this in early 2020, it sent a warning to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Fortunately, this time the systems in Veldhoven were not at risk.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s own computers are also not immune to breaches. In August 2018, several factories had to be shut down when an employee from one of <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s suppliers logged on with a laptop, only to accidentally spread a variant of the Wanna-Cry computer virus.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Audrey Tang, the Taiwanese Minister of Digital Affairs, brings this up at the Global Cybersecurity Summit in September of 2022, while the head of information security at <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, James Tu, is in the audience. The government and the tech industry in Taiwan are closely intertwined, and when it comes to protecting the chip factories, any resource that can help to shield them is sent to the frontline.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Then, a Dutch face appears on the screen. It is Aernout Reijmer, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s head of information security. Beaming in all the way from Veldhoven, he has woken up in the middle of the night to give a presentation on the ‘Circle of Trust’ – a collaboration between the security chiefs of the ten largest Dutch companies. Members of the group have permission to share real-time alerts about digital vulnerabilities and hacker groups with their suppliers, as well as share data from security services. The initiative serves as a bypass, as there is still no official mandate in place to help protect economic activity. In the Netherlands, policymakers tend to underestimate the strategic importance of the manufacturing industry.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The vulnerability of the suppliers had become apparent when a cyberattack shut down <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span> in October of 2021. As a precaution, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had temporarily closed its corporate network to the outside world. One year later, <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span>’s Willem van der Leegte, accompanied by an <span class="fft-kk">AIVD</span> representative, visited the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> campus to share his experiences with nearly two hundred entrepreneurs from the Brainport region. <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span>’s point: if even the largest industrial company in the Netherlands can be struck down by a cyberattack, smaller suppliers to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> need to act quickly and prioritize their own security. All it takes is one ransomware attack, one hitch, to affect the entire value chain.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Machine design is not the only sensitive matter <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> manages. Veldhoven also keeps an eye on almost all the major chip factories across the globe and receives real-time updates from the lithography systems of manufacturers who voluntarily share their production data. Most are happy to do so, which allows <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to solve technical problems more quickly and keep track of the total production capacity. This way, chip manufacturers can better estimate how many machines they need to reorder. If they order too many machines, it creates overcapacity, and excess chips can cause the market to collapse. That is not what any manufacturer wants. You might think ASML wants to sell as many machines as possible annually, but it would much rather have a balanced market over the long run.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> introduces this approach after the major crisis in 2009. The connected manufacturers can only view their own current and forecasted share of global chip production. This means <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has a unique and total overview over the entire chip production landscape. This highly sensitive data is so strictly guarded you can count the number of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> employees with access to it on one hand. The system is audited by the customers and is even more tightly secured than <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s own blueprints.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Veldhoven finally gets it: the dikes need to be reinforced to protect the trade secrets of Europe’s most valuable tech company. But some things never change. At the beginning of 2023, no one is surprised when Martin van den Brink leaves his phone completely unattended for an hour in the back of a taxi in Taipei. Anyone could have taken it, but he is not bothered by the thought. He trusts it will find its way back – these things always do. The people around him realize that Martin’s mind leaves little room for everyday matters. That’s hard when you are thinking fifteen years ahead.</p>
