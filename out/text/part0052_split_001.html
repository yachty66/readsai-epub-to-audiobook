			<p class="ff-platmetwit">It is a mess, and the host is loving it.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">It’s the summer of 2016, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s annual barbeque for the top brass has become a mud bath. Martin van den Brink is hosting the event from his secluded house, located just off the side of an unpaved road. The guests are parked in an adjacent field, and after hours of torrential rain, it has turned into a swamp. More than fifty cars are totally stuck – even the tractor Martin borrowed from his neighbor has been swallowed by the sludge, and he has to arrange for a second tractor to come and pull the cars free.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin quickly changes into an old outfit and pulls on his favorite plaid shirt. This is going to be hilarious.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is not about schadenfreude for Van den Brink, but about observing the social experiment unfolding in the Brabant mud right before his very eyes. The <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> leaders are vying for priority, falling all over their cars and bickering with their partners. When the pressure is on, the mask tends to slip – then you really get to know who your colleagues are.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Frédéric Schneider, one of the French board members, cannot get his Renault Espace out of the slop. Hans Meiling easily shoots past him in his four-wheel-drive Volvo. A smart choice of car, and an even smarter piece of advice: ‘You should always back in, and make sure your escape route is clear. Even cavemen knew that.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A few <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers try another exit, but get stuck on some stray tree stumps. The software of one driver’s Tesla is refusing to switch to off-road mode, leaving him stranded while his colleagues pore over the manual.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One Saab gets dragged even deeper into the ground by the tractor. Chief financial officer Wolfgang Nickl does not like the thought of anyone else coming near his car, let alone a tractor, so decides to handle it himself. His wife, wearing high heels and a white evening dress, pushes from the back while he sits behind the wheel. ‘<span class="fft-cursief">Einz, zwei…jetzt!</span>’ The car lurches forward, and so does his wife. Face-first into the mud. In the end, it takes more than four hours to free the last car.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For Martin van den Brink, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is one big social experiment. He loves to create some confusion and rub people the wrong way. Just to see how they function, or if they waver. He wants to gauge your reaction by toying with you, like a cat playing with a mouse. But as soon as a weakness or technical problem is found, Van den Brink encourages the others to step in: ‘You see what he’s struggling with? You need to help him.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">According to people that work with him, Martin has an uncanny ability to see right through you. He can smell when something is off, but he will never tell you what to do about it. You are there to spar, to defend your position. Not to agree with every word he says. Head of the research department Jos Benschop knows this all too well: ‘The worst thing you can say to Martin is, “Oh, blessed Brink, what a brilliant plan!”‘</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In such chaotic and often noisy technical debates, the most creative solutions tend to arise. And it is the perfect way to bring problems to light. After all, there only needs to be one weak link in a lithography machine, one loose bolt, for the entire chip factory to come to a halt.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As a result, even the highest level of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> leadership is clued in to the technical details. ‘It can be extremely annoying,’ Frits van Hout explains. ‘It looks as if we think we always know better. That’s not the case, but we need to know some details if we want to understand why something is going wrong. We have to dig to find out whether an error can occur once a year, or much more often.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink’s approach laid the foundation for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s remarkable corporate culture. He created the environment that tried to preserve the feeling of a start-up in a global tech company. An impossible task, some might say, and it certainly had its battles.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Many managers at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> try to emulate Van den Brink’s style. There is even an acronym for this in the company: <span class="fft-kk">BIG</span>, or Brink Imitation Behavior (‘<span class="fft-cursief">Brink Imitatie Gedrag</span>’ in Dutch). This confrontational approach is particularly popular in the technical teams. Colleagues openly challenge each other, and things get rough at the top, even by Dutch standards. ‘You should have read the fine print in the patient insert before coming to work here,’ Roger Dassen advises. The possible side effects include a hardened soul and thick skin.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Dassen’s colleagues come down hard on him when he struggles to implement the <span class="fft-kk">ONE</span> system in 2019. He knows it was nothing personal – after all, everyone knows that<span class="fft-kk"> ONE </span>is a tough task. Yet the intensity still affects him. He immediately notices upon his arrival that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers are constantly at each other’s throats. ‘In the beginning I thought, “Holy shit, what’s going on here?” But when they would leave the room, they would slap each other on the back and go for a coffee or grab a beer.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Finding mistakes is the number one pastime at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. And it is never just about technology. Peter Baillière notices colleagues even complain about the ‘wrong’ fonts being used in a PowerPoint presentation. He has his own baptism by fire when he takes over the HR department in 2018. During his first presentation to the board of directors about complex European privacy regulations, he is abruptly cut off. He doesn’t fully understand the details of the legislation, and at this level, that is simply not good enough. ‘Here at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, you always need to be able to go into depth,’ he is told. This is the big league, not a tea party. The new director of HR walks out of the meeting, convinced he is about to be fired on the spot.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Many <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers have stories of similar near-death experiences. You have to suffer through it, pick yourself up and go on to win a few of those battles. It is a way to see if you are cut from the right cloth: full of substance, and short on ego. At <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, you are so often confronted with something that you have no idea about, that you never bother to brag about the things you do know about. ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers can spot authenticity a mile away,’ according to Peter Wennink. They value someone who puts the company first, not themselves.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The continuous focus on mistakes tends to either leave newcomers wrestling with the strict rules, or drive them away completely. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> traditionally struggled to retain ‘lateral incomers’, especially in managerial positions. There used to be a nickname for such new colleagues: a <span class="fft-cursief">Horizontaal Instromende Stropdas</span>, or <span class="fft-kk">HIS</span> (which translates to a ‘Horizontally Inbound Necktie’). For the first thirty years, it was rare to bring people from outside into key positions. As a result, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> remains more or less isolated from the outside world.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When Wennink and Van den Brink both become president in 2013, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers receive ‘cultural awareness’ training to learn how this confrontational style is perceived by colleagues from other countries. The first lesson: ‘Put yourself in the other person’s shoes before you say or do anything.’ But for many <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers, this empathy is a one-way street. They assume everyone should behave as Dutch as possible. Straightforward and direct – that’s how it should be.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, not everyone is raised on a diet of Dutch directness. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> employs people from 144 different nationalities in locations all over the world, and the level of education is high across the board. Ninety percent of workers have university degrees or some form of higher education, and they range from physicists and mechanical engineers to software developers and computer scientists. They are all brought together by one thing: a passion for technology. But there are major cultural differences between the science students in Veldhoven and the foreign branches. In Asia, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s style is far looser than the strict hierarchies found in local companies there. You never openly criticize your boss there, even if they are a lousy manager. To reassure international employees, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> started an anonymous reporting point called ‘Speak Up’ for complaints about managers or unethical behavior. It is a way to make your voice heard.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For employees in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, home to more than seven thousand <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers, the Dutch directness quickly crosses the line into bluntness. ‘As Americans, we would never treat each other like that,’ assert the employees from the San Diego division.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> in Wilton is taken over in 2001, workers there initially experience their Dutch colleagues as tough and aggressive. And that is not the only cultural difference: American employees feel reluctant to just throw their problems on the table. It does not align with the Americans’ winner mentality and their quest for perfection.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Wilton staff is given training to overcome this hesitation, a course that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> compares to the management of a Dutch polder. A polder needs to be protected from the water by dikes, and everyone needs to trust that the others have properly checked their part of the dike. The moral: don’t hide your own <a id="_idTextAnchor065" class="calibre3"></a>shortcomings, but show your needs so others can help you. Don’t try to save the world on your own – just like the famous Dutch fairytale by Hansje Brinker, if you try to plug the dike with only your own finger, everyone drowns.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Titles hold less weight in the Low Countries. You earn respect by contributing something – that’s how the best ideas come to the surface.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">That’s the scientific ideal, believes Joost Frenken, who led the <span class="fft-kk">ARCNL</span> research institute and worked closely with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> for many years. ‘No one tells the other what to do, and if you have a good plan or find a mistake, you speak up. Even a newcomer who has only been there for a week is expected to contribute to the discussion.’ It is typical of the Dutch, he thinks. ‘In other countries, hierarchies get in the way – the egos of people at the top suck all the power out of collective thinking.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Rank may rarely play a role, but there are still laws in the Veldhoven jungle. Peter Wennink knows them well: dare to speak up, say what you think, and always make enormous PowerPoints to bombard your colleagues with data.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A day in the life at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is filled with competition: who can present the most numbers, and who can find the most mistakes in other people’s slides? According to former head of the development department Herman Boom, ‘there is always someone saying that what you are working on is not correct. It can take weeks for engineers to accept that they could actually be wrong. And forget about praising the colleague who pointed it out.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The engineers work in teams on alternative solutions, competing to see which one of their brainchildren will end up in the machine. <a id="_idTextAnchor066" class="calibre3"></a>The end result is often a combination of ideas: rarely can any invention be traced back to a single ‘progenitor’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A great deal of attention is paid to mistakes, but compliments are rare. ‘One colleague of mine created a separate folder in his mailbox. If he ever receives a compliment, he can save it in there,’ one manager says. To encourage the Dutch to loosen up with their praise, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> devised an app called the ‘Recognition Tool’. Colleagues are now able to give each other a virtual pat on the back: accumulate enough points, and you receive a gift card for 50 or 250 euros to spend at an online shop.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Technical milestones are modestly celebrated, often with only a T-shirt or a photo. Veldhoven is about business, and there is always another deadline looming. When the light source achieves a new power record, the <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> machine produces one or two million wafers per year, or the two hundredth <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine is delivered, the reaction is the same: a solitary thumbs-up. But never celebrate a first, according to Frits van Hout. ‘You never know if the first machine will keep working. It might as well melt down.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Difficult issues also receive the most attention – ‘easy problems’ are not interesting enough to distinguish yourself as the smartest in the room. This phenomenon creates the perfect breeding ground for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s firefighting culture. Employees spring into action at the first sight of trouble, but there is less interest in avoiding problems altogether. As one manager puts it, ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> encourages heroes. If you jump on a plane to solve something urgent, then you’re the man. If you just deliver on what you promised, you won’t hear a thing.’ However, this firefighting culture also risks cultivating arsonists – people who create a problem only to ‘heroically’ solve them <a id="_idTextAnchor067" class="calibre3"></a>as a way to put themselves in the spotlight.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span> is a sprinter forced to run a marathon. The last serious downturn was in 2009, and the company has been exponentially growing ever since. There is no time to pause and figure out how to improve the organization. When the chip industry temporarily slows down again in 2023 and orders are delayed, you can almost feel a sigh of relief in the air in Veldhoven. Almost.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At this point, Veldhoven has a flood of new recruits to soak up. In 2023, two-thirds of the employees had been with the company for less than five years, and a quarter for less than one year. Ten thousand new people joined in 2022, which is six thousand more than originally planned. Colleagues with more than two years of experience become coaches and buddies, enlisted to help the newcomers land gently on planet <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. It seems to work. Ninety-five percent of the new hires were still employed after twelve months, a rate of retention unseen in the rest of the tech industry. But training these new employees takes time, and the workload for existing staff suffers as a result.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Yet the most important problem is the lack of empathy and people skills often displayed by the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> managers. Even if you do not take the shouting or blunt behavior personally, it can still be hard to stomach. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers may be more accustomed to this style of management, but in other organizations, such harsh confrontations can easily be taken as crossing the line.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is longing for change,’ says HR chief Peter Baillière in 2023. In his eyes, the company is a teenager that desperately needs to mature. That explains why more than fifteen hundred leadership training sessions are held each year, and the entire company’s top management needs a workshop to prepare <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> for the future. With Baillière set to retire in 2024, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needs to grow up fast.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The upcoming generational shift is causing concern. Along with Peter Wennink and Martin van den Brink, a large group of engineers from the early days are nearing the end of their tenure at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. These veterans possess invaluable technical know-how that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> will soon no longer be able to rely on. You cannot find their knowledge in any manual: they teach by word of mouth and in the cold light of the work floor. The old guard knows their way around the organization blindfolded: they know exactly who to call when needed, or who to chat with at the watercooler. With so many people coming in at once, this collective memory is fading, and the veterans are slowly disappearing with it. What once happened spontaneously now needs to be documented and formalized into rules, or risk being lost altogether.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers have never been fond of rules. They put their own spin on their work, which often leads to conflicts. One such conflict occurred between the employees in the factory and the development department when they each clashed over resources. Their respective managers had to resort to their schoolyard tactics, and decided to work out of the same office to set an example to the employees and demonstrate that they share a common goal.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This problem also lies at the heart of the issues with 5L. Peter Wennink had his own term for what <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needs more of: ‘horizontal loyalty’. ‘When we hire new people, they immediately dive into their own specific task. It’s almost a law of nature at this point. That might work for that particular task, but not for the overall picture.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needs leaders with more experience to help foster connections between hyper-specialists. It seeks to cultivate ‘T-shaped’ managers – individuals with expertise in one area and a sufficient grasp of the surrounding topics. To become a ‘T’, you need to have worked at the company for a longer time and have a few roles under your belt.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink also thinks the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> employees need to come out of their shells. As ever, the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> leads by example and adjusts his morning routine to make himself more approachable. At 7:30 a.m., he always has a coffee, croissants and yogurt with muesli at Plaza, the restaurant on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s campus. The idea is simple: ‘Anyone can come speak to me there if they want to.’ When a young <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’er from abroad dares to overcome the imaginary hurdle and tap him on the shoulder, it makes Wennink’s day.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Meanwhile, diversity at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is increasing in all areas, whether it be gender, sexual orientation, nationality or neurodiversity. The baby boomers with sideburns and lab coats that started the venture in 1984 are now only a fraction of its population. The majority of employees belong to generations X and Y, with an average age of 39 years old.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Since women account for only 20 percent of the workforce, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> makes an effort to increase the number of female employees. When a TV documentary about <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> aired featuring a large number of young female employees, Martin van den Brink quipped that his days are mostly filled with being around overweight white men. After all, the number of women at the top of the ladder is still limited, and only around 11 percent are in management roles.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But there is no systematic undervaluing of women’s opinions in the company, at least according to Sunny Stalnaker. ‘As a physics student, I was already used to working in an environment with few women. When it comes to the content of what I’m saying, they take me seriously at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. The fact I’m a woman doesn’t come into play – and if it occasionally does, it doesn’t bother me.’ Once, when someone from another department turned to her male colleague and asked whether Stalnaker was correct about a technical issue, she quickly responded, ‘Excuse me, but didn’t I just tell you that’s how it is?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The estimated percentage of people with autism or <span class="fft-kk">ADHD</span> at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> far outnumbers the average. The highly specialized work, revolving around focusing on complex problems that require prolonged attention to the smallest details, makes it well-suited to some autistic traits. Van den Brink himself makes no secret about being dyslexic, and actively advocates for targeting this neurodiverse group. They are precisely the analytical and creative thinkers <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needs, but also often the ones who find it difficult to put themselves in other people’s shoes.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Integrating so many new faces and personalities into the well-oiled organization is a tough task. How do you maintain harmony in a workforce of more than forty thousand headstrong, highly educated people? <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> claims to provide a work environment where you can be free to play the nonconformist, but still have to take your colleagues into consideration. It is a contradiction summarized in 2020 by the introduction of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s three core values, otherwise known as the ‘three C’s’: Challenge, Collaborate, and Care. Collaboration had been incorporated into the reward structure – those who focus solely on their own tasks instead of collaborating receive a lower bonus. Challenge has never been in short supply, but mutual care left something to be desired.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Just before the <span class="fft-kk">COVID</span>-19 pandemic, all <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers were given a card game to reinforce the three C’s. It was like a game of Scattegories, but filled with dozens of personal questions, such as: ‘What have you done for a teammate this week?’ or ‘When were you last asked for your opinion?’ This helped to maintain a sense of comradery during the pandemic, but the intensity of the workload in the aftermath made playing cards a luxury no one had time for.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">According to Peter Baillière, the three core values reflect Martin van den Brink’s approach. ‘People shouldn’t copy his behavior, but rather his intentions and values. If you know Martin well, you know that he’s a caring person. He’s dominant, sure, but there’s no ego or politics behind it.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink’s style of leadership is not unique to the chip industry. One of the supervisory board members sees similarities in the media sector, in which companies are also often led by a visionary in the field who is fixated on the small details and demands absolute dedication from everybody. Even if that means shouting. The same combination of micromanagement and tight deadlines permeates the work at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. It became an organization ready to leap into action at a moment’s notice: everything needed to be done yesterday, and would be outdated by tomorrow. Van den Brink describes his fiery meeting style as ‘a fair fight based on arguments,’ although his methodology matured over the course of his tenure. ‘I don’t shout at someone because I know that person is afraid of me and needs to become even more afraid. I shout because I want to set something in motion, to get something happening. That’s why I put emotion into it. And I do it more for some people than for others – I know how far I can go.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When the world switches to Teams calls and Zoom meetings during the pandemic, it becomes difficult to gauge the right amount of ‘emotion’ to administer. ‘During video conferencing I miss 80 percent of my feedback loop,’ he recalls. Martin needs to read body language, and it is difficult to do that when people are just a small square on a screen.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">He even insists on sitting down with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s Asian customers in person. Despite the travel restrictions, in September 2021 Martin flies together with Peter Wennink to Taiwan to meet <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> leadership at the Indigo Hsinchu Hotel. They arrive to find the hotel completely divided in two: one half for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, the other for the <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’ers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink and Van der Brink are <a id="_idTextAnchor068" class="calibre3"></a>supervised at all times. When they leave their rooms, they are taken via a predetermined route to a large meeting room in the center of the hotel. A demarcation line runs through the center of the room, and the attendees are made to sit four meters apart, separated by plexiglass. A guard is posted to ensure that everyone wears their face masks, even during dinner. The participants can barely understand each other and need to use microphones. ‘Still, it was a fantastic meeting,’ concluded Van den Brink afterwards. The plexiglass may have stopped any viruses from spreading, but it could not stop Martin from reading people.</p>
