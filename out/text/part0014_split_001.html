			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In 1990, Willem Maris took the reins as <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s new chief executive officer. The mechanical engineer transferred from a management role in Philips’ chip division to find himself at the helm of an unstable company. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> barely made it through the early ’90s, relying heavily on the acquisition of government subsidies and a rare act of generosity from the head of Philips, Jan Timmer. In 1992, Timmer initiated a harsh restructuring plan, named Operation Centurion, with devastating effect. He cut fifty thousand jobs from Philips’ three hundred thousand-strong workforce, hitting Eindhoven and the surrounding Brabant area particularly hard. The mass lay-offs left scars in the families of many Brabanders, and the abandoned Philips buildings turned the city of Eindhoven into a desolate place. It was the worst moment for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to find itself on the brink of collapse and desperately in need of a 36-million-guilder loan.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Miraculously, fellow board member Henk Bodt managed to sway Timmer, or as he was now called, ‘the Butcher’. The chip industry was facing a lull; if <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> went to market with an improved machine, they could take it by storm. It was now or never. To everyone’s surprise, the Butcher agreed and granted the loan. According to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s former financial director Gerard Verdonschot, this was a well-calculated risk. Disbanding <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> at that moment would have come at a far greater cost for the parent company than this final bet on success. The only condition was that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had to repay the loan extremely quickly; sure enough, nine months later Verdonschot and Maris triumphantly presented the check. The pace was beginning to pick up.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As Philips downsized and the region of Eindhoven plunged into an economic crisis, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> continued to grow. Philips’ machine factory Acht kept up the supply of parts to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, and the NatLab continued to tinker with the lithography technology. But more was still needed. As per the business model, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> only dealt with the development and assembly of the machines, buying up around 90 percent of the parts. Luckily, there were plenty of manufacturing companies around the corner in Eindhoven already supplying to Philips. New specialist companies were frequently opening up, often founded by former Philips employees jumping the sinking ship. And so a network of manufacturers took root in the region that knew each other intimately and spoke the same technical language. Quite literally: every component for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has a 12-digit code, based on the 12nc system that Philips used for decades in its own factories.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Forty years after its founding, the code of all <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> components still starts with ‘4022’. That number can be found everywhere, from the warehouses in Veldhoven to the many suppliers and chip factories the world over. You can even use it to identify the second-hand components up for grabs on Ebay. It is the key to a system that holds together a complex global chain of production, a code that unmistakably bears the DNA of Philips.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">VHE</span>, the family business of Harry van Hout (no relation to Frits), was one such regional supply company. They produced the cables and power supply boxes for the first lithography machines. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> decided what is needed, and <span class="fft-kk">VHE</span> would oblige. However, cooperation with Veldhoven in the early days was chaotic. <span class="fft-kk">VHE</span> found themselves beholden to a volatile market and to a company that did not hesitate to react accordingly. Orders were halved or doubled at the drop of a hat, leaving some companies hesitant to pin too much of their sales on such a fluid base. Especially given how loose and informal the contracts were: most only needed a single sheet of paper, a few verbal agreements and a handshake – that’s how they got things done in Brabant.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘If there was a problem, there was always someone who would lend an ear,’ recalled Harry van Hout. ‘During one of the first dips in the chip market, I was suddenly told they didn’t need my deliveries for a month. I’d already ordered materials worth hundreds of thousands of guilders, so this was a serious problem.’ One phone call to financial director Verdonschot sufficed and 750,000 guilders were transferred that same day. As long as everything kept working, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> knew the money would find its way back.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In those early days, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had only two requirements for its suppliers: the work had to be good, and it needed to be fast. Gerard van der Leegte’s tool shop was one of the first <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> partners, providing precision parts meticulously cut, ground or drilled to exacting specifications for their lithography machines. However, unlike the standards it required of others, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> itself was not that precise. As Van der Leegte recalled, ‘You were given a pile of drawings and could just figure out on your own which parts you wanted to supply.’ The purchasing department were not tech-savvy and didn’t really pay attention to prices, so were prone to taking offers at face value. Of course, some suppliers abused that trust and submitted highly inflated bills. If it was supplied to Veldhoven, you could get away with asking the higher price.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Orders from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> soon accounted for half the revenue of Van der Leegte’s business. This made him quite happy to be at the beck and call of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s chaotic schedule. Gerard didn’t mind answering calls for a new order at ten o’clock in the evening or well into the weekend. But he refused to sign a contract that would commit him to grow at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s pace. That astute decision spared him from misery in the years when the chip market dipped. By the year 2000, when Gerard gave his toolmaking shop a more international-sounding name, GL Precision, he noticed the relationship with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had soured. ‘It became far less friendly than it once was,’ he recalled. It signaled the beginning of a much tighter procurement regime from the company.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The supply network was key in keeping Veldhoven competitive, fast and flexible. It was too important to be managed by the purchasing department alone. Each board member was assigned responsibility for several of the companies, needing to provide presentations on financial projections and explaining plans for the next generation of machines so manufacturers could sign up to supply parts. They also regularly put on get-togethers and networking events for the entrepreneurs to encourage a feeling of comradery. Rounds of golf racked up, an activity chosen for its easy pace, always topped off with drinks and dinner. Martin van den Brink, an early riser from the pool of engineers and already the bearer of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s technical conscience, usually only showed up towards the end of the day. Golf was never his thing.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The partner network grew, reaching some seven hundred companies in size. The majority were based in Brabant, but not far south in the Belgian city of Leuven sat one of the most important players: imec. Founded in 1984, just like <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, this research institute spanned across several Flemish universities and afforded chip manufacturers and their suppliers the chance to work together on ‘precompetitive’ research. No one building a chip factory or fab wanted to run the risk of investing in the wrong technology – the costs in this industry are too unforgiving for that. All the steps needed to produce a working chip are intertwined, and even the smallest change can have a huge impact on the process as a whole. So imec established itself as a high-tech garage, a place for the entire industry to come and figure out its future.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Imec housed equipment from all the major suppliers. Everything from machines for measuring to etching and deposition – the application of new layers to the wafer – could be found in their cleanrooms. Initially these consisted of <span class="fft-kk">US</span>-made lithography machines, but with European government support imec installed the first <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> systems from <span class="fft-kk">ASML </span>in the early ’90s. These used lasers to produce a deep ultraviolet light; compared to the standard mercury lamps, the light those generated had a far smaller wavelength, allowing for the imaging of smaller structures and far more complex chips.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">From that moment on, all the major players in the semiconductor industry would stop by the high-tech lab in Leuven to experiment with the tool from Veldhoven. As <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> grew in importance, imec was better able to map out the road ahead and judge what innovations the coming years might bring.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the end of the 1980s, imec’s chief executive, Luc Van den hove was traveling around the world trying to decide between Japanese and American lithography machines. Never did he expect to find what he was looking for in Veldhoven, only a hundred kilometers away from where he started. According to Van den hove <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s technology had clearly already been pioneering in those early years. But what stood out was the driven corporate culture, an ethos of total commitment, whipped up by none other than Martin van den Brink.</p>
