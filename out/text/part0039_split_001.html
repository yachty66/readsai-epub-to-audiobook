			<p class="ff-platmetwit">You may think a lithography machine with a price tag of hundreds of millions of euros would be able to make perfect copies of chip structures. Think again.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The mask, which carries the original image of the chip, does not leave an exact replica on the photosensitive layer. The chemical processes that occur on the wafer create rough and messy lines. However, with mathematical models, you can calculate how to shape the mask so that, despite these deviations, a pattern emerges that will transmit the electric signals on the chip without fault. You can compare it to the beauty filters on TikTok or Instagram, which correct the ‘imperfections’ on your face to make you look like a model. However, making a mask takes much more time than snapping a selfie, and it takes weeks for the pattern of the chip to be converted into a flawless image.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Computational lithography, as this technology is called, is an indispensable link in the production of chips. Martin van den Brink knew this when he charted out <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s long term strategy in the late ’90s. As chips become smaller, so does the room for error, and at a certain point using software to make these adjustments is the only way to keep producing chips that work.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Dutch company gathered the required expertise through a series of acquisitions. In 1999, they took over American start-up MaskTools, and in 2006 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> paid over 270 million dollars for Brion, a company with branches in Silicon Valley and China. Brion developed software that simulates the operation of lithography machines to create masks. The production of a complex <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>-mask costs more than half a million euros and takes a huge amount of time to calculate. If you use smart software to accelerate this development, you save yourself a lot of money.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> also developed its own measuring instrument, the Yieldstar, which traces errors on wafers with a camera. And in 2016, it bought the Taiwanese company <span class="fft-kk">HMI</span> for 2.75 billion euros. Their machines check the wafers by taking random samples with an electron beam. Each of these applications generates vast amounts of data, all of which is then stored on large computer systems in the chip factory itself. It’s a vicious cycle: more computing power is needed to design and manufacture chips for more powerful computers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Silicon Valley is the birthplace of the semiconductor industry, yet the last major chip factory in this region closed its doors in 2009. However, the specialists in chip software remained in California and soon found their place among the new tech giants.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> Silicon Valley is located on West Tasman Drive in San Jose. Brion’s and <span class="fft-kk">HMI</span>’s Asian origin is immediately noticeable by the giant dragon made out of balloons in the lobby, positioned proudly next to the wall displaying the company’s patents. Chinese New Year is an important holiday here, as is the Dutch celebration of King’s Day on April 27. Just to make sure, the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers also celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Yu Cao, the co-founder of Brion, thinks it fosters a sense of community.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Silicon Valley’ is different to the other <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> locations. Eric Meurice, the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> who signed the acquisition of Brion in 2007, urged the founders not to let Veldhoven control them too much: ‘If <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> tries to push you into their corporate structure, ignore it. And otherwise, just give me a call.’ Veldhoven has a rigid project organization entirely focused on building scanners, and this does not match how <span class="fft-kk">HMI</span> and Brion operate.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Brion supplies its optical proximity correction software, or <span class="fft-kk">OPC</span>, to companies that are also located in San Jose like Samsung and GlobalFoundries. The measuring technology of <span class="fft-kk">HMI</span> faces far more competition than <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s lithography systems do. But when put together, these three elements – measuring technology, correction software, and the scanner – form the pillars of ‘holistic lithography’. It is an ecosystem carefully built by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to reduce the margins of error throughout the chip factory and increase its effectiveness. The applications division, as this branch is known within <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, now generates billions in revenue.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is just one of thousands of tech companies clustered together in Silicon Valley. This is why the trams in San Jose were plastered with huge <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> logos throughout 2023 – every little bit of recognition helps. Just like all tech companies in Silicon Valley, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is constantly on the hunt for talented software specialists. Employees visit technology conferences and universities in the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> to explain what this Dutch company and its seven thousand American employees do. It even has an advertising campaign on TV. A catchier slogan for people not already working in the industry would have been good – at least according to software specialist Ahmad Elsaid. ‘You know the first thing my wife asked me? What on earth does “pushing technology one nanometer at a time” mean?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In San Jose, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> faces tough competition in the quest for talent. Between 2018 and 2020, a substantial number of workers left for other nearby companies, such as Google and Facebook, while others also ventured into software development for Apple, Waymo, or even Tesla’s self-driving cars. While big tech companies in Silicon Valley might offer higher salaries, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is a more interesting employer to physicists. At least, this is what Chen Zhang believes, an employee at the Brion division: ‘Here, we operate on the dividing line between fundamental science and economics, and you get to learn something new every day.’ Zhang studied atomic, molecular and optical physics – this is why she prefers to work on optimization software for chip machines, rather than beauty filters for TikTok.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The primary language in San Jose is English, but you’ll often hear Mandarin as well. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> Silicon Valley is in close contact with hundreds of colleagues who develop software in Shenzhen, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has a team of 1500 people who maintain measuring equipment in chip factories, among other things.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In one of San Jose’s cleanrooms, a brand-new <span class="fft-kk">HMI</span> system is being inspected, the hood open like a car in a garage. The device uses electron beams to scan for defects on the wafers. This version has a Dutch touch: the electron sensor is supplied by Mapper, a company based in Delft. After the start-up went spectacularly bankrupt at the end of 2018 – more on that later – <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was able to acquire the e-beam technology along with one hundred experienced technicians. Mapper dreamed of building a competitor to Veldhoven’s scanners, only to watch their promising multibeam technology end up in an <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> product. The scientists from Delft are now collaborating with San Jose on a radically enhanced version, slated to be ready by 2025 and capable of handling the unbelievable amounts of data required to inspect the wafers in detail.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In San Jose, everything revolves around data. The datacenter for performing the heavy calculations is located next to the cleanroom. Currently, the software runs on regular processors or <span class="fft-kk">CPU</span>s (central processing units), but the new versions will also make use of the cloud and operate on fast graphics processors, convenient for applying artificial intelligence to the data sets.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The explosion of measurement data has made it impossible to capture all the variables at play into predictable formulas. Therefore, Brion uses AI to understand the interplay between the light beam, the mask, and the chemical reactions on the wafer. The technique used for this is machine learning, in which neural networks look for patterns in an enormous set of data.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In machine learning, the computer draws conclusions that you can’t replicate. The software can even predict in advance how you should set up a lithography machine to get the best results, prompting Martin van den Brink to coin a term for it: voodoo software. ‘No one knows exactly what goes on with machine learning’, he expresses. ‘But if you rely solely on AI, you’re not adding any extra value. Then you don’t need to understand what it’s doing anymore, and that’s where the problems start.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink believes technology should be something you can calculate and understand. From the very start, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> built its designs on the laws of physics and mathematical models. Even the most complicated optics from Zeiss are ultimately a calculation, so you know that what you make is correct and, in the end, that it also works.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Martin hates laziness,’ clarifies Jim Koonmen, the head of operations in San Jose. ‘He can’t stand it if you say, “I can’t make sense of the model, so I’ll just train a computer and hope for the best.” He challenges the people here: why do you choose machine learning over modelling that uses the physical principles?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Overdependence on dark magic is risky: if you do everything with voodoo software, you’ll no longer differ from your competition. Van den Brink sees it as a valuable addition, but only as a final step to speed up reaching a solution. ‘We need to distinguish ourselves. If we don’t include the added value of our physical models, then anyone can do it.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">He compares it with generative artificial intelligence, such as Chat<span class="fft-kk">GPT</span>, which can create readable text in seconds, but doesn’t add anything new. ‘As if you asked Chat<span class="fft-kk">GPT</span> to write a book about Martin van den Brink,’ he says. Ultimately, the software from San Jose is the glue that binds all the components of the machine together: without it, one would never be able to optimally align the lighting system, the mask and the lens.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But software has its drawbacks. Top of the list: it is easy to copy. In 2014, six former Brion employees made off with trade secrets, stealing – among other things – two million lines of software code, algorithms and manuals via email and used the details to start a competing company in Silicon Valley. When Samsung wanted to terminate its contract with Brion because a new competitor with a suspiciously good product had emerged, alarm bells sounded at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. This new company was called Xtal, pronounced ‘crystal’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2016, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> filed a lawsuit against the former employees. It took Yu Cao, founder and technical conscience of Brion, dozens of hours on the stand to explain the complex evidence. When the judge and jury then examined the Xtal code behind closed doors, it became evident that algorithms had indeed been copied.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was awarded 845 million dollars in compensation in 2019. But with Xtal long bankrupt, there was nothing to recover. The high amount was intended as a deterrent, a serious signal for anyone else considering sneaking off with trade secrets.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Incidentally, Xtal founder Yu Zongchang started a Chinese counterpart around the same time. His company, Dongfang JingYuan Electron, is still in business and even receives subsidies from the Chinese government. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> urged its customers to steer clear of Dongfang, yet leadership decided not to publicize the lawsuit. After all, they thought, it involved less than 1 percent of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s revenue, and both the stolen information and the contract with Samsung were safely secured.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">That decision completely backfired. The Dutch newspaper <span class="fft-cursief">Het Financieele Dagblad </span>reported on the lawsuit and pointed the finger at the Chinese government, suspecting them of orchestrating the data theft. Much to the dismay of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, this turned the affair into a political issue. The company expressed disappointment over the ‘conspiracy theories’ in a press release, citing: ‘No evidence has been found for this.’ This did not keep <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> from being thrust into a new arena: the world of geopolitics. And there, everything Chinese is regarded as suspicious.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Due to the tech war between the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and China, an invisible barrier runs through the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> facility in San Jose. The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> government does not cooperate with issuing new employment contracts, and some employees, due to their nationality, are not allowed to work on <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> programs or other advanced technology intended for Chinese companies. The hundreds of people working for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in China are concerned about the ramifications of new export regulations on their home country. There is one advantage though: ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is in the news so often, at least my parents in China now understand which company I work for,’ says Chen Wang.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The media and politicians are discovering how crucial <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is to the major chip factories. The eyes of the world are beginning to focus on ‘that company’, as the Dutch tech giant is called in the corridors of Capitol Hill. The mysterious company that, with over forty thousand people and a touch of voodoo, manufactures the most complex machine on earth. The genie is out of the bottle.</p>
