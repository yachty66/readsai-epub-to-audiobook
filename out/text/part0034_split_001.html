			<p class="ff-platmetwit">As a boss at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, you have little say. For <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> Eric Meurice, this was an unexpected culture shock. Direct orders were taken more like starting points of a conversation, and that was not at all the Frenchman’s style. Like his favorite historical figure, Napoleon, he preferred to be the center of power – to the point of being downright intimidating, as his employees frequently experienced. If you crossed him on a bad day, his responses would be harsh and blunt. But outside of working hours, Meurice cut a far more relaxed, even entertaining figure. He was the first to open the conversation at dinner: ‘What can’t we talk about? Sex, politics and religion. Well then, which one should we get into first?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘The Dutch have one big disadvantage – they’re not French,’ joked Meurice as he left in 2013 following the end of his second term. He wasn’t shy with his opinions: ‘Dutch people just aren’t quick to accept a clear leader that is willing to ramp up the pace.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Believe what you like about the Dutch, but <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> clearly has a leader: Martin van den Brink. ‘<span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>’ might not be on his business card, but he’s without doubt the rock the company relies on. He’s the one setting the technical agenda, helping to write patents and determining the strategic acquisitions. It is his name that commands respect throughout the entire chip industry. And if one of his plans gets blocked in the boardroom, he’ll dig in and stick to it until he gets his way. When it comes down to it, it is clear who has his hand on the wheel.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">An autocracy with a hint of anarchy grew around Van den Brink, a culture in which everyone has the freedom to propose a better idea. As he said himself, ‘at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, you should have the feeling that you can change something. It’s the people that make the difference.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With around 13,000 employees in 2013, this made <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> a challenge to manage.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">As Eric Meurice’s contract was coming to an end in 2012, the board of commissioners began to wonder who could succeed him. Did <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> really need another outsider to keep Martin in line? The commissioners knew they already had a potential leader within the executive board – the personable Peter Wennink. By many, he was already viewed as <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>. As chief financial officer, he was outwardly the most prominent figure in the company, he knew the suppliers in the region on a first-name basis, and spent his time advocating for the interests of the Dutch manufacturing industry in The Hague. Only by looking at his lanyard could you know his official role.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Since 1999, an ever-deepening bond of trust had grown between Wennink and Van den Brink. They knew exactly what they had in one another. They oversaw acquisitions together, visited clients together, and stood shoulder to shoulder in the face of the fury of the French <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>. These harsh confrontations bonded them. When Meurice and Van den Brink clashed, which happened often, Wennink was the one who kept things together. He shone when it came to building bridges. But this was also tiring – after all, it’s never a good idea to keep two roosters in the same henhouse.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In Wennink’s view, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> didn’t need another boss from outside like Meurice. It was better off without any ‘big dogs’ trying to put a leash on Martin to satiate their ego. He didn’t want to have to deal with someone ‘who barks and pisses at every tree they come across’, and neither was he excited about reprising his role as a mediator. He would rather just do it himself. But not without Martin. In the end, both Van den Brink and Wennink expressed an interest in leading the company, but also said they would accept the other as leader if that was the decision. The board could see that they were both essential to the company. They complemented each other perfectly. ‘They’re like yin and yang,’ as one commissioner put it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And so, in 2013, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> appointed two president-directors. Wennink became president and <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>, Martin van den Brink president and technical director. An unusual setup, but there was no doubt about their individual roles. The <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> steers and Martin sets the course – that’s just the way it is at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Wennink knew this. As he said, ‘With Martin, you have the golden ticket in the palm of your hand. Are you really going to mess with that?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink came up with a simple formula for their salaries: combine the previous <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> and <span class="fft-kk">CFO</span>’s salaries and divide it by two. It was less than Eric Meurice received, but they would more than make up for it soon enough.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Over the course of the next six months, the duo worked out a plan for the future of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. But the collaboration wasn’t immediately all smooth sailing. Wennink was initially unsure in his new role, a feeling exacerbated by his colleague’s tendency to meddle with everything. Van den Brink’s extensive knowledge of the chip industry, combined with his fiery temperament, proved overwhelming. For a non-engineer like Wennink, every visit to Martin’s office felt like a test.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The two presidents revived a tradition from the time of Willem Maris and put on a yearly barbeque for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s top management. As the only directors with yards spacious enough to set up a tent for 150 people, it was alternately hosted at the homes of Van den Brink and Van Hout. Wennink had a more nondescript house in the suburbs of Veldhoven – although it still boasted a wine cellar.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink never doubted Martin’s technological instinct. ‘With Martin, the goal is always clear. We know what machine we’re going to deliver next year, and we know what we’ll be doing in ten years. It’s easy – there’s no discussion about it, and that makes life simpler.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But leading as a pair is tricky. You need keep your ego in check, and there isn’t any room to wing it with what you tell the outside world or other <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers. Peter and Martin do not always agree with each other, but what matters is that they learned to understand each other, inside and out. Often, they knew exactly what the other was going to say before they had even said it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Every few weeks, the two would take a long walk in the Kampina, a nature reserve in Brabant. The space afforded them a quiet moment to catch up, whether about work or how their kids were doing. It is the same area where you can often spot Van den Brink on a morning bike ride in the nearby woods. He has two children from a previous marriage and two stepchildren with his third wife, while Wennink has two children from his second marriage.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink is the one who wants to keep everyone on board. He understands the confrontational culture of the technical teams: ‘The clashes are not so much about ideology but about technology. It is about showing who is right – everyone wants to be the smartest in the room.’ He wanted to make <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> into a place where everyone felt comfortable, not just the hardened engineers. And to him, constantly shouting and yelling is pointless. ‘People just get used to it. They’ll say, “Yeah, sure, whatever.’ I can also get emotional – but if it only happens every now and then, it’s much more impactful.’</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">But there’s no yin without yang. And Van den Brink had no reservations about showing his anger. Sometimes, people left his office in tears. ‘Who the hell invited that loose cannon!’ he exclaimed out of nowhere during a meeting, angered that a competitor was at a presentation for clients. Once a team member explained, his anger evaporated just as quickly as it came on. He just wanted to know what was going on; not letting it go would just be a waste of time. A joke followed to clear the air.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Most meetings with Martin never got past the first page on the agenda. He would hijack the conversation almost immediately, sometimes talking for three quarters of an hour about what he had just read in the paper and leaving fifteen minutes for the topic on hand. He knew what he was doing: one gift he received from a colleague was a Delft Blue tile, inscribed with one of his regular closing remarks: ‘We didn’t see many slides, but we grew mentally.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin made a habit of challenging everyone who sat down with him. Even if he was fully on board with your proposal, he would take the opposing stance to test your conviction. Sarcasm was a favorite weapon, often used as soon as he had an inkling of doubt. ‘Interesting. And that definitely works just as well as your previous idea?’ he would cynically ask.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Most <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers grew accustomed to his outbursts. It was just a part of life in Veldhoven. The real thing to worry about was if he kept looking at his laptop. Bad news: apparently, you’re not important enough to pay attention to.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">His colleagues consistently praise his aptitude for abstract thinking. You can see this in action: when speaking with intense concentration, Martin keeps his eyes clenched shut for seconds at a time. As his focus deepens, his right hand instinctively goes to his forehead, three fingers raised in the air – as if he is pushing his thoughts back in to keep them from wandering off.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But as sharp as he is on technical details, Martin can be remarkably absentminded in his day-to-day life. When traveling, he was prone to grabbing the wrong suitcase from the conveyor belt or simply forgetting his belongings altogether. ‘Oops. My laptop is still on board,’ he exclaimed while navigating customs at a Korean airport. He had simply walked off the plane without his personal items. As one colleague joked, ‘the Dutch consulate in California has a stack of spare passports ready for him.’ Martin’s unwavering focus on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> left little room for anything else. If it is not on his mind, it does not exist.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">While Martin was forgetting about the outside world, Peter Wennink was actively pursuing it, representing the company at shareholder meetings, to suppliers, the media and any politician that would listen. The two still managed the relationships with chip manufacturers together, as they had been doing for years: meeting after meeting, flight after flight, continent after continent and then, as always, back to Veldhoven. For Wennink, personal engagement is everything in the chip industry: ‘It’s never the lawyers that arrange a deal. It’s the people that need to make the decisions. The ones that sit by each other, look each other in the eye and say, “I trust you.” That’s how it happens.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Yet during the early years of their partnership, confidence in <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> was waning. Technical problems were pushing back the introduction date, and a disastrous presentation in Silicon Valley in 2014 only made thing worse. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s development machine had broken down, leaving <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> pessimistic about the project. ‘Moore’s Law is dead!’ jeered the American analysts in their comments. They were celebrating like kids in a schoolyard: you could almost hear the ‘Naah-nah-nah-naah-nah!’ as they wrote the headlines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The mood was solemn as the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> delegation gathered for breakfast in San Jose the morning after the presentation. Martin van den Brink tried to limit the damage by leaking technical details to the media, claiming that the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine at <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> only had a minor problem and would soon be up and running. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needed the world to trust that Moore’s Law was alive. Still, Samsung was waiting to receive the promised light source – one powerful and reliable enough for chip production. At least 100 watts, as agreed upon.</p>
