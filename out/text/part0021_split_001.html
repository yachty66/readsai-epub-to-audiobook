			<p class="ff-platmetwit">At the end of the ’90s, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> underwent a changing of the old guard. <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> Maris departed in 1999, leaving only three months to show his successor the ropes. Maris’ replacement was the former head of Philips’ semiconductor division and British national Doug Dunn, who was brought in to whip <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> into shape. It was now a publicly listed company, and shareholders had started to keep a keener eye on their wallets. They demanded tangible results. Dunn’s mission was clear: <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needed to work more efficiently, or they would not stand a chance of keeping up their pace of growth. And so, together with the bright-eyed Peter Wennink, he set out to instill greater discipline within the organization.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Producing over 200 lithography machines annually (and, in 2000 the number was to surge to 368) required constant tight-knit coordination between the designers, the factory, the procurement department, and the customer service division. However, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was not a well-oiled machine. Kinks in the process were still being worked out, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s project leaders showed little concern for controlling costs. They were wholly focused on getting the scanners built and sent to the manufacturers as quickly as possible. Simultaneously keeping a lid on spending was never on the cards.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">So Dunns first task was to bring the tech-heads back to earth and introduce them to the reality of financial responsibilities. However, he soon found that attention at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would quickly fade at the mention of stringent supplier regulations and inventory management. Eyes would roll and bodies would slump back: they had better things to think about.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Although such disinterest is common among engineers, the reason so many felt at home in Veldhoven was precisely because of the harmony between their values and the culture of the company. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had its roots firmly in the Rhenish model, in which money isn’t the sole benchmark of success and profit is only really visible over the long term. In the economies of Rhenish countries, such as Switzerland, Germany, and France, solidarity and craftmanship are traditionally deemed far more important than a polished set of quarterly figures. This is why <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> sought its suppliers for their most essential components in these regions: they value what matters the most in high-tech manufacturing. However, as the company and its worth grew, a style of management started to seep in from a world that revolves around short-term profit and the satisfaction of shareholders: the Anglo-Saxon style.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Few things are more Anglo-Saxon than a British <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span>, apart from a British <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> with a Scottish right-hand man. For <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> this was Stuart McIntosh, a former chief operating officer at Philips with an accent so strong it took many in Veldhoven more than a second to realize he was speaking English. McIntosh quickly took the lead on overseeing the day-to-day affairs, allowing Dunn to step back and maintain a more remote and supervisory presence.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Veldhoven now had no choice but to become familiar with the Anglo-Saxon way of working. Under Willem Maris you could feel comfortable expressing disagreement or questioning your superiors. Now <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had become a place where one had to be far more mindful of their words. This did not sit well with the employees. Not only that, but as Steef Wittekoek observed, Doug tended to ‘shoot from the hip’, expressing himself in a hard and rude manner without nuance or consideration for who might get caught on the other end.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The duo further failed to win over hearts with their double act during meetings. For example: one time, while an employee was struggling to address a difficult question, Stuart leaned over to Doug and asked – audible to all – ‘What do you think, want to hear the rest or shall we call it quits here?’ He then sharply turned to the worker. ‘If that’s all you have to offer… then hopefully your successor can do a little better.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Despite this, chairman of the board Henk Bodt was pleased with the rigidity of Dunn’s command. So long as the Brit had a grip on the finances and Martin van den Brink still felt free to do what he needed to do, the company stood a chance of continuing its growth. Dunn himself actually enjoyed his time at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, though admitted he was ‘not the easiest to work with’ while in Veldhoven. It would take some time before he mellowed out.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Those who worked with Dunn state that not much was needed to bring out the jerk in him. And even with that attitude, he was still unable to prevent his company sleepwalking into a crisis. By January 2001, not much seemed to be wrong. Although signs indicated there would be a mild downturn, the annual report was still optimistic. Official plans estimated that 500 lithography systems would need to be produced to meet demand. But internally, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> estimated they could sell seven to eight hundred, nearly twice the amount as the previous year.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">All of a sudden, the market crashed. The dot-com bubble had already burst in March 2000, but now the internet companies were starting to drag the tech sector into the downturn. This then spread to chip manufacturers and their suppliers, and to the suppliers who provided the suppliers and so on. The whole production chain had ground to a halt.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Instead of 700 machines, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> sold a measly 197. Hundreds of millions of euros worth of surplus inventory filled the books, and cancellations from chip manufacturers poured in daily. On paper, the company was bankrupt. Radical cost-cutting measures would be needed. Around this time, Dunn confided to an analyst, ‘We’re in free fall, and to be frank, I can’t see the bottom.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Anglo-Saxon spirit stirred. Dunn dug in, making short work of his purchasing obligations, a regulation that allowed suppliers to limit their risk in the event that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> reduced orders. The state of affairs was rammed home to suppliers: ‘This is how the industry works – get used to it. There will be a downturn every five years. Everyone knows this. You need to be as flexible as <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. One year orders could double, the next they could half. Either get with the program, or get lost.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Banging your fist on the table’ was his name for this approach. The only problem was Dunn had a knack for punching it through.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Harry van Hout, who had been supplying <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> through his company <span class="fft-kk">VHE</span> since 1984, ran into trouble when his turnover dramatically dropped from 30 to 12 million euros. The bank was breathing down his neck: he had already laid off 100 people and was losing millions on inventory. The family business was on the verge of collapse. Van Hout strode into the office of the procurement department at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, tossed their agreement on the desk and gave an ultimatum. Supply needed to continue and he needed to be paid according to the contract: a deal is a deal. The purchaser took one look and swept the contract off the table. Their response: either <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> goes bankrupt, or the suppliers do.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">VHE</span> ended up drawing the short straw. Fortunately, Van Hout had a plan. Bankruptcy was declared Wednesday afternoon, and by Friday he was already back to supplying <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The relationship with Zeiss also soured over <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s abrupt reduction of orders. But as far as Dunn was concerned, it was up to the Germans to suck it up. ‘In this world, you need to have your eye on the ball. It’s pointless producing so much in advance. By the time you’re done chip manufacturers will want something else anyway.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">True to their word, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> followed up the spat by asking Zeiss to prepare for the next technological leap, which involved bringing in new materials, taking on additional staff and expanding capacity. But the Germans were reluctant to risk more money on behalf of such an unpredictable and rude client.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">COO</span> McIntosh pulled no punches with Zeiss’ management. Following an extensive VIP tour of Zeiss’ new factory and cleanrooms, the otherwise incomprehensible Scot left nothing on the table before leaving for his taxi. ‘This all looks nice – you must be very proud. But in the end, you’re a shitty supplier that doesn’t deliver what we need.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In Oberkochen, after another meeting, Dunn and Martin left the building and began the long journey back to Veldhoven. Even Martin, the loudest voice in most rooms, thought his <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> had crossed the line.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Doug, you’re pushing them too hard. We need Zeiss, and they’re doing their best.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">He knew the relationship with Zeiss was essential for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s future, something Doug quietly recognized. ‘Martin was already sorting out the inefficiencies at Zeiss, and then I started amplifying the problems.’ Some things never change: Doug would always be ready to jump in guns blazing.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As soon as they hit the autobahn, they put the pedal to the metal. It was going to be a long five hours back to Brabant.</p>
