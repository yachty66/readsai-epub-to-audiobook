			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Then came the atomic bomb.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the words of the American media, on May 15, 2019 Donald Trump decided to ‘go nuclear’ in the trade war with China. He placed Huawei on the Entity List, a feared list by the Bureau of Industry and Security (<span class="fft-kk">BIS</span>) of the Department of Commerce. American companies wanting to supply goods to the Chinese telecom company were now required to apply for a license, which was then assessed against national security criteria. It is a disguised export ban, preventing Huawei from purchasing new American software and chips – all the technology that is essential for making phones and equipment for telecom networks.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Entity List had been successful before. In 2016, the export rule brought Chinese telecom company ZTE to its knees after it violated<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> sanctions against Iran and North Korea. With its chip supplies cut off, ZTE almost fell into bankruptcy, until the company admitted guilt in 2017 and settled for 1.2 billion dollars. While studying the ZTE documents, the Americans uncovered evidence suggesting Huawei had also turned a blind eye to the rules of the sanctions, and it was this trail of breadcrumbs that led to the arrest of Huawei’s <span class="fft-kk">CFO</span> Meng Wanzhou in Canada at the end of 2018.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A mention on the Entity List was intended to be the final blow against the Chinese giant. According to the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, the company was an undeniable threat to their national security: it allegedly engaged in the theft of trade secrets, conducted espionage for China, and was even said to be under the influence of the Chinese army. Tim Morrison, one of Trump’s security advisors until the end of 2019, left no room for doubt about America’s position: ‘Huawei is the tool of the Communist Party. This company must be destroyed. Out of business.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But the desired nuclear effect never happened. Within five days, the ban on Huawei was postponed by three months, gifting the Chinese company the chance to stock up on semiconductor supplies. In addition, Huawei’s subsidiary HiSilicon produced the most advanced chips in <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s factories, which were not yet subject to<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> export regulations. ‘We’ve let Huawei become too big,’ sighed Morrison as he later looked back on the failed blockade. ‘We could still surprise ZTE, but Huawei knew what was coming and was prepared for it.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Trump administration also underestimated the effect of export regulations on its own chip industry, as the unilateral export restrictions encouraged Huawei to search for alternative suppliers outside the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. This alarmed American chip companies, as they suddenly faced losing a third of their revenue. They warned the administration about the dangers of ‘decoupling’ their industry: eliminating the mutual dependency between Chinese and<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> enterprises would push the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> even further behind, as revenue from China provided much-needed additional funds for the development of new technology.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But as a company, criticizing Trump’s policies was a dangerous thing to do. One exclamation mark-laden presidential tweet could send their stock price plummeting in no time. The tech sector found itself knocking at the door of the Department of Commerce and searching for allies in the Pentagon. Their point was simple: if the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Department of Defense wanted superior weapons built with homegrown chips, it needed a thriving chip industry that would earn enough to stay ahead of the game and keep on top of the most cutting-edge technology. And so, behind the scenes, American chip manufacturers continued to secure licenses to export to China.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Huawei case marked the moment when<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> export restrictions turned into economic weapons. ‘It all started with Huawei’s violation of the sanctions against Iran and North Korea,’ a former staffer at the Department of State explained when discussing how he coordinated the measures against Huawei during the Trump administration. ‘But then all kinds of layers of policy were thrown on top, because everyone was suddenly concerned about a company from China becoming the largest in 5<span class="fft-kk">G</span> technology while having possible backdoors in their software.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The general public never received a good explanation. ‘That would be a waste of bureaucratic time. The Trump administration was good at making quick decisions and leaving<span class="fft-kk"> </span>us to clean up the mess.’ This was typical of the Trump era: shoot first, aim later.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Responsibility for the Entity List isn’t attributed to any one person or institution. It’s a joint undertaking, compiled by four American departments: Defense, State, Energy, and Commerce. The Bureau for Industry and Security, which implements export controls, falls under the latter.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Coordination was lacking from the moment Trump won the keys to the White House. The President himself was surprised by his victory in the 2016 elections, and had not prepared any policies or selected experts for key political appointments within the departments. Lower-level officials suddenly found themselves grappling with significant decisions. Mess up, and you were fired immediately. Staff were wary of presenting too many issues to the president due to his inclination to act impulsively, often with the subtlety of a bull in a china shop.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Responsible officials deliberately kept their plans away from what they called ‘Trump’s madness’. With one tweet, he overruled a decision to put <span class="fft-kk">ZTE </span>back on the Entity List and hinted that the ban on Huawei could be reversed if the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and China struck a trade deal. On February 18, 2020, he tweeted: ‘The United States cannot, &amp; will not, become such a difficult place to deal with in terms of foreign countries buying our product, including for the always used National Security excuse.’ And then, in Trump’s trademark style: ‘<span class="fft-kk">THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!</span>’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The tweet sparked widespread confusion among America’s allies: the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> had been urging them all to expel Huawei from their networks over security concerns. Now, it seemed to be the one holding open the door. In January, Republican politicians introduced yet another threatening bill, proposing that the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> should cease sharing intelligence with countries that continued to use Huawei in their networks. The Netherlands was alarmed – two out of three mobile providers in the country used Huawei equipment in their cell towers and networks. The American ambassador to the Netherlands, Pete Hoekstra, tried to ease concerns in an interview with national newspaper <span class="fft-kk">NRC</span>. ‘We’ll figure it out,’ was about all he could promise.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Contradictions piled up as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took a different approach. He wanted to split the internet in two and called on all ‘freedom-loving’ nations to join The Clean Network. This was the catchy name for an online world without China: a vision of a mobile network with no Huawei, smartphones without WeChat and TikTok, and a cloud without Chinese servers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Meanwhile, one of Trumps economic advisors pushed for the rapid development of ‘anti-Huawei’ technology with Dell, Microsoft and <span class="fft-kk">AT&amp;T</span>. Attorney General William Barr envisioned the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> taking a controlling stake in European network providers Ericsson and Nokia to ‘weaken Huawei’s drive to domination’. One day later, the White House dismissed his idea.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The world watched in astonishment as the wild schemes continued to trip over one another. Rationality was in short supply in Washington, overshadowed by a mix of clashing egos and an overeagerness to act. ‘It wasn’t like being in one henhouse, but three henhouses mixed together,’ one Trump advisor later reflected.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In May 2020, Trump reached for heavier artillery and prohibited <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> from producing advanced chips for Huawei. This was enforceable due to the Taiwanese use of American tools in their factories, such as design software for chips and chip machines. With this measure, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> extended its extraterritorial power to target Huawei. Every chip factory in the world used American technology, which meant every chip factory was brought under American export regulations.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With Huawei out the picture, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> instantly lost a significant portion of its revenue. The repercussions made their way to Veldhoven, as the Taiwanese immediately scaled back their orders for chip machines. What followed was a chain reaction no one saw coming. Out of fear that they could be placed on the US’s banned list at any moment, other Chinese tech companies started stockpiling chips en masse. This contributed to the chip shortage in the automotive industry, as they ordered not only the latest processors but also the less advanced chips used for smartphones. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s order books were overflowing, and suddenly they were pressing <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> for lithography machines capable of a higher production output.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Chinese fears were well placed. In December 2020, the largest Chinese chip manufacturer <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span> landed on the Entity List after allegedly producing chips for military purposes. The Americans came up with a new set of export rules: tools for advanced processors were no longer allowed to go to <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>. Chip machines for older technology were permitted – at least in theory. This also affected <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>: without an export license, it could no longer supply spare parts from the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> to <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Huawei was left gasping for air. With the American company Google no longer allowed to supply its Android operating system to Huawei, smartphone sales plummeted – no one wants a phone without YouTube or Google Maps. The Huawei name was tainted by the relentless accusations, and the export rules for chips cast doubt over the capabilities of future products.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Chinese telecom company also lost ground in the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> after governments there tightened their network regulations. However, the approach was less aggressive than the American’s. Europe didn’t want to step too heavily on the toes of its trading partner China, a crucial supplier of vital raw materials.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">All <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> member states were left to decide for themselves whether to allow Huawei in their networks. However, there still was a European safety directive they needed to comply with. The <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> spent months deliberating over this ‘5<span class="fft-kk">G</span> security toolbox’: to the policy makers in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, this felt like they were watching the grass grow. They were able to add a company to their Entity List in two days, without telling anyone or providing a public comment. That’s the American way.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Compared to the barrage of<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> actions against Huawei, decision-making in the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> was undeniably slow. Nevertheless, something was beginning to change. By the end of 2019, the Netherlands demanded that network providers should be able to easily remove suspicious equipment from their mobile networks if it originated from ‘a supplier under the influence of a malicious party’. Any mention of Huawei, or China, was strictly avoided. The Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands, Xu Hong, responded in an announcement in the national newspapers. Without explicitly naming the country, he accused the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> of ‘politically pressuring’ the Netherlands to cut ties with Huawei without providing any evidence to validate their claims: ‘What they have done is anti-historical, and anti-civilization.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In response to the intense scrutiny, Huawei took the initiative and presented the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> with a magnifying glass. A so-called ‘red zone’ with a direct line to Shenzhen was set up in the Huawei Cyber Security Transparency Centre in Brussels. This Transparency Centre was strategically placed between the embassies, the European Parliament, and European cybersecurity organizations. To enter the red zone, you first must pass through a secured door and metal detector, and then make your way along a row of rooms bearing the names of famous inventors like Shannon, Einstein and Tesla. This is how the Huawei employees see themselves – as inventors, not as extensions of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Running along the floor is a data cable that, via a secure connection, leads all the way to the main office in Shenzhen. From this building in Brussels, experts were now able to delve into the source code of Chinese telecom equipment and sift through millions of lines of software to root out any potential backdoors and vulnerabilities.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, source code is not the main concern. The ‘tech war’ transcends technology – at its core, it is a battle of economics and politics, of cultures and ideologies. European governments worry about a different type of connection to China. They fear the country is transforming into a totalitarian state, capable of forcing Chinese multinationals to spy for the Communist Party. And that poses a significant risk to the 5<span class="fft-kk">G</span> infrastructure in the West.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As for the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, Huawei is an ideal target, but it is certainly no longer the endgame. The stakes in economic warfare are huge, and Washington is just getting started.</p>
