			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The robot squeaks a cheerful tune called ‘Dreamy Waterland’, a Chinese folk song from the eighties. The approaching melody lets the Huawei employees know that they need to step out of the way: the self-driving cart, loaded with parts, is coming through.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is the summer of 2017. About 21,000 people are at work at Huawei’s factory in Dongguan, a city that emerged from the outskirts of the Shenzhen metropolis. The first floor is filled with fifty production lines that churn out 38,000 amplifiers every day for the cell towers of mobile networks. Go a level higher, and you can find Huawei employees assembling smartphones. It is monotonous work, so every two hours the staff are allowed a ten-minute break. Most spend that time staring at their phones, but twice a day they come together for a collective singing and dancing session – a chance to shake out the legs after hours on the production line.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In 2017, Huawei still had plenty of reasons to celebrate. The company was riding high on the mobile revolution, with hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens glued to WeChat. Thanks to this large market, as well as state subsidies and cheap labor, Huawei was able produce its technology far more cost-effectively than European competitors Ericsson and Nokia. Exports to Europe accounted for nearly 30 percent of their revenue, and Huawei was already going head-to-head with Apple’s smartphone sales.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Huawei became a high-tech hit, and the Chinese undertaking stuck billions into the development of its own internet technology and software. In 2017, the European Patent Office received a total of 2398 patent applications from Huawei – more than from any other company. This bombardment of applications was down to one thing: Huawei was preparing for 5<span class="fft-kk">G</span>, the latest technology for mobile networks. 5<span class="fft-kk">G</span> allows for the large-scale connection of devices to the internet, making it an essential link for the future while society, industry and the economy continue to digitize. Control this network, and you control the world.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Born out of a military-academic project in the United States, the internet has always remained under American influence. It is no surprise that China has taken an interest in the underlying network technology: after all, the country has over one billion internet users – which is more than North America and Europe combined. Technological power is shifting from the West to the East, simply because the majority of the 5.3 billion internet users live in Asia.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> watched the rise of Huawei with suspicion. The major American telecom providers are prohibited from using any Huawei equipment in their networks, with American policy makers claiming as early as 2012 that the Chinese company lies, cheats, and steals. Huawei’s smaller counterpart, telecom company ZTE, is not considered much better.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, providers in the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> are impressed by Chinese technology, which is far cheaper than what they are used to. Besides, the Snowden affair left a bad taste in the European’s mouths. In 2013, whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the CIA was engaging in eavesdropping on a mass scale, using backdoors at the biggest tech companies as well as hacked phone networks and internet cables. Even European government leaders were being spied on by their own allies.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Snowden’s revelations created a dent in the trust held in<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> technology. As a result, the largest telecom provider in Germany, Deutsche Telecom, built a public cloud together with Huawei in 2016, which was intended to become an alternative to the dominant American cloud providers such as Microsoft and Amazon. And just like that, Chinese technology was embedded into the veins of European datacenters and communication networks. The Americans were dumbfounded, thinking it was incredibly naïve.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Huawei, which loosely translates to, ‘what the Chinese make possible’, began in 1987 as one of the first independent technology companies in a special economic zone around Shenzhen. This city produces electronics for the entire world – all the ingredients to make a smartphone, computer or TV are readily available here. It is also one of the locations where the Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn assembles iPhones for Apple, in mega-factories with hundreds of thousands of workers. Directly across from the Foxconn-complex lies the Huawei Campus, which houses tens of thousands of employees in massive dormitories constructed by the company. Right next door is the office of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, with a fabulous view over an enchanting lake with black swans. It’s an image drawn straight from a fairytale.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">China is the largest manufacturing hub for electronics globally, which makes it the world’s biggest consumer of chips. But with the local chip industry still in its infancy, the country needs to import almost all of its advanced processors, the majority of which come from the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. Likewise, the memory chips that China incorporates into its electronics are predominately sourced from foreign companies. To reduce this dependency, Xi Jinping, leader of the Communist Party since 2012, wants to kickstart China’s own semiconductor industry. With his ten-year ‘Made in China 2025’ plan, more than 100 billion dollars in state support has been reserved for the construction of new chip factories and the acquisition of foreign chip technology. China’s goal is to be 70 percent self-sufficient in products from ten strategic sectors by 2025, including the most important building blocks for modernization – chips. Gone are the days when Chinese chipmakers were cumbersome state-owned enterprises: now, chip factories receive capital through national and local investment funds to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship. Although a string of failures and corruption cases arose, this policy also resulted in successes like memory manufacturer <span class="fft-kk">YMTC</span>. Founded in 2016, <span class="fft-kk">YMTC</span> became almost instantly <a id="_idTextAnchor035" class="calibre3"></a>competitive and Apple considered sourcing a large portion of the memory for iPhones from this company. However, the deal was considered too sensitive in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, and Apple had to back out.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">China is also able to compete in the development of 5<span class="fft-kk">G</span> chips for phones, via companies like Huawei’s subsidiary HiSilicon or Unisoc. These companies were founded shortly after the turn of the millennium, just like the national chip champion <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>. This foundry drew heavily from <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s playbook – to the extent that it lost several lawsuits claiming theft of Taiwanese patents – and made full use of the experience gained by Chinese ‘knowledge workers’ abroad. This is also part of Xi JingPing’s strategy – entice high-tech experts from Western companies so they can serve their motherland.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Xi dreams of a Chinese renaissance by 2049. The People’s Republic will have existed for one hundred <a id="_idTextAnchor036" class="calibre3"></a>years, and should have reclaimed its status as the world’s most powerful civilization by then. China was still the richest country in the world at the end of the nineteenth century, but the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> soon took the top spot. By the last decade of the twentieth century, China was beginning its transformation from a poor communist country into the world’s second-largest economy. This rapid rise was due to their leader Deng Xiaoping, who modernized the country and partially opened it to the global market through economic zones like Shenzhen. For a long time, Western nations – in particular the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> – thought that China would democratize if it could participate in global trade. The first American president to seek harmonization was Nixon, who made a historic visit to communist China in February 1972 in the hopes of forming a counterforce with party leader Mao Zedong against the Soviet Union. In the 1980s, President Ronald Regan relaxed existing export restrictions against China, and under Bill Clinton the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> even launched advanced satellites from Chinese rockets. This event took place in 1996 and caused a stir, as it seemed to overstep the boundaries of American national security. However, Clinton brushed off the criticism, assuring the public that ‘there was absolutely nothing done to transfer any technology inappropriately to the Chinese.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Following years of negotiations, China became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001. Many foreign entrepreneurs had already been lured in by the vast Chinese market and its availability of cheap labor. They brought capital and expertise, which has made China wealthier and more knowledgeable, but not any more democratic. Open criticism of the administration is prohibited, protests are suppressed, and the government fails to protect foreign companies against corruption and the theft of their technology. Chinese people are monitored with sophisticated surveillance and facial recognition systems, and their online behavior is analyzed and censored. For the Obama administration, China’s growing economic and military power in Asia prompted a shift in foreign policy towards the Asia-Pacific region: China had become a threat to the American liberal world order and had to be contained, or even pushed back. American political parties may be deeply divided, but they agree on one thing: China’s technological advance is a threat to the free world. And soon, this arch-rival will be more powerful than America in the field of artificial intelligence and cyber espionage.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">To America, this sounds familiar. It stands on the threshold of another ‘Sputnik Moment’: in 1957, the communist Soviet Union became the first country to launch an artificial satellite, Sputnik, into Earth’s orbit, in a display of technological superiority that deeply shocked the Americans. Now, just as in the space race between the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and the Soviet Union in the fifties and sixties, China and America are locked in a struggle for technological dominance. And with 5<span class="fft-kk">G</span>, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> has once again been left in the dust. America was once a pioneer in network technology, but its telecom suppliers have either gone bankrupt or been acquired. Now, Americans are dependent on European providers and have to watch as those are outcompeted by Huawei.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In early 2017, the Obama administration began laying the groundwork for an answer to Xi Jinping’s ‘Made in China 2025’. However, the actual implementation of this strategy fell to Obama’s successor – Donald Trump. But he had a different agenda: he first wanted to put an end to the trade imbalance with China.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">On January 20, 2017, with his hand on two Bibles, Trump swore to ‘make America great again’. And sure enough, the trade conflict between the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and China rapidly evolved into an all-out tech war, with Huawei as the initial target. The globalized chip industry was sucked into a geopolitical conflict, and to the astonishment of Veldhoven, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> found itself thrust into the spotlight. Tech companies soon became familiar with Trump’s favorite weapons: unpredictable tweets and equally unpredictable export rules.</p>
