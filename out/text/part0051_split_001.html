			<p class="ff-platmetwit">‘…and thank you all for joining us today.’</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">As soon as the operator formally concludes the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> investor call, Peter Wennink and <span class="fft-kk">CFO</span> Roger Dassen start chatting in the Veldhoven boardroom. It is July 2021, and they have just finished presenting the second quarter results. Over the course of an hour, a team of seven financial experts watched as Dassen and Wennink took turns answering questions from analysts. They were there to field any unexpected questions, but none arose. Everything was about the chip shortage and the urgent need for extra lithography machines. As Dassen summarizes in the investor call, it was nothing more than ‘twenty different ways to ask about capacity.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The pair have known each other for a long time. Just like Wennink, Dassen worked for the accounting firm Deloitte, and together they make for a well-oiled machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Roger, any changes in the stock price?’ asks Wennink.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Oh, just 595, and then back to 600,’ comes Dassen’s reply.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink has been doing these investor calls for over twenty years. ‘Every time is showtime. For one hour, you’re at your most vulnerable.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is growing so fast it is virtually creaking – just like the tall headquarters in Veldhoven. When the wind blows, you can hear the steel structure groaning. ‘That’s how it is supposed to be,’ says Wennink reassuringly, mimicking the noise.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A little further away, construction workers are putting the final touches on the logistics center at the Veldhoven campus. This 35-meter-tall state-of-the-art warehouse, nearly a kilometer in length and the size of ten footballs fields, rose from the ground in less than two years. On the top floor there are offices for three thousand people, while below there is space for thirty thousand pallets.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> previously spread its logistics center across different locations. Spare parts and components for new machines were kept in separate warehouses, and the assembled systems were packed for transportation in an entirely different hall. But this new building handles all the logistics processes at once. This is 5L, the new heart of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, with different ‘flows’ for both ‘in and out’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With its moving robots, automatic shelves and a spiral slide to distribute packages, the new logistics center is supposed to be a technical masterpiece. Everything is seamlessly connected to the aorta, the central corridor that leads to the cleanrooms in <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s factories. On paper, it looks fantastic.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">5L goes live at the end of July 2021. But as soon as the switch is flipped on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s new lifeline, it clogs up. Anything that can go wrong does go wrong. The software controlling the warehouse is not integrated with the software in the factory. Circuits blow, and there are no boxes or labels. Components always need to be carefully cleaned before going into <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s factory, but this is no longer possible. Nothing goes in, and nothing goes out.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A long line of trucks from suppliers outside the warehouse tells the story of the congestion inside. Some drivers angrily take to Twitter –  ‘I’ve been sitting here twiddling my thumbs for one and a half hours’ – while others turn around to make other deliveries, only to turn around again as <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> urgently needs the parts. ‘The worst f#cking address in the Netherlands, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> 5L,’ tweets one trucker.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Sunny Stalnaker is on vacation when she receives a message from a Korean customer: ‘Where is the lithography machine we ordered? It should already have been on a cargo plane.’ As it turns out, the logistics center has been unable to find any packaging materials and the machine is still at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Stalnaker hopes it is just a temporary congestion, and her email mentions ‘a minor issue with the relocation of our warehouse.’ But when she returns one week later, 5L has completely seized up. Right in the middle of an extreme growth spurt, while her customers are screaming for more machines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For the first week, no one dares to inform top management that 5L has brought the factory to a standstill. When Peter Wennink takes the chairman of Intel Omar Ishrak on a tour of the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> factory in early August, an unfamiliar scene greets them. In the cleanrooms there is barely a worker in sight. ‘What happened?’ he asks an employee. ‘Where is everyone?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘They all went home – we haven’t received any materials in over a week,’ is the response.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wennink speaks Dutch to keep his guest from figuring out what is going on. The company that builds the most complicated machines on earth has failed to figure out how to move a warehouse. The second the door closes behind Ishrak, the polite smile vanishes from Wennink’s face. Furious, he goes straight to his desk to hammer out an email: ‘What the hell is going on?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the next quarterly report, Roger Dassen notes that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s logistics center experienced ‘startup-issues’. Meanwhile, a crisis team has been assembled in Veldhoven. The issues at 5L kept replacement parts from being delivered to chip factories, and a mass shutdown of machines is the last thing the world needs during an acute chip shortage. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> can feel the weight of the entire chip industry on its shoulders.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the beginning of August, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> sends out mobilization calls to thousands of workers, pleading with them to help 5L. A desperate tone permeates the emails: ‘You can make the difference!’ The floor soon fills with volunteers from all corners of the company, dashing back and forth with packing slips and bubble wrap. With no software to fall back on, there is no choice. It has to be done by hand, or not at all.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The volunteer teams wear yellow vests, the logistics staff wear blue. They already have a nickname for 5L – ‘5-Hell’. Employees in the factory have been warning for months that the move could lead to trouble, but their voices never reached the top of the tower.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Hundreds of millions of euros in revenue disappear because of the problems in 5L, and employees are hugely stressed. The works council is seriously concerned, as they write in their 2022 commentary on the board’s remuneration policy. The bonuses for the top management do not take into account the chaos on the work floor. Absenteeism in the factories has increased, and the company’s counselor is fully booked. With so much pressure to deliver machines, employees feel they are not allowed to say no, which leaves them stuck in an impossible position.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And the company never says no to a customer. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s orderbook may be overflowing, but the can-do mentality is set in stone and Veldhoven bends over backwards to increase output. They re-use parts to help expand capacity, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> starts its own speedy delivery service. Normally, machines are tested twice: once in Veldhoven, and once when they have been assembled in the chip factory. Performing some of the Veldhoven testing at the customer’s site instead shaves three to four weeks off the delivery time. Chip manufacturers jump on the offer; they would rather have a machine that will probably work than one that arrives weeks later. After all, they have desperate car manufacturers and angry politicians breathing down their necks.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The serious delays 5L causes last for more than three months. The extensive investigation into what went wrong concludes it was a case of mismanagement. The risks were heavily underestimated, and what was assumed to be a small project for the factory turned out to be open-heart surgery for the entire company. Furthermore, there was never a plan B or backup in the event that things went south. Even Frédéric Schneider, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s chief operating officer, is caught by surprise.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Some managers are given new positions after the mistake, but nobody gets fired. Punishment was never part of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s culture. ‘Accountability is one of our weaknesses,’ Sunny Stalnaker bemoans. But Peter Wennink sees it differently. ‘Of course, we were very angry. In other companies the person responsible would have been fired, but I felt just as responsible myself. In times like these, we all need to take a look in the mirror.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The volunteer initiative in the logistics center was good for comradery, but it also brought <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> face-to-face with some harsh truths. ‘We don’t know how to grow,’ explains Peter Ballière, head of human resources. ‘We are so focused on customers and products that we’ve forgotten about ourselves.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When Baillière started in 2018, he thought he would be entering a high-tech heaven where every process was tuned to perfection. The opposite was true. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was seriously lagging, and all the systems and processes that you would expect in a large company were simply not in place.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Baillière had worked in the automotive industry for years, where everything revolved around optimization – every penny counted. As he discovered, the laws in Veldhoven are different. Meeting customer deadlines is crucial, and profitability seems to be an afterthought.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has reached a size where they recognize that processes needed to improve. ‘But without turning into a bureaucracy,’ Baillière adds. If there is one word that riles up an <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’er, it’s that B-word.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The company struggles with the organizational changes. The freedom demanded by the technical people conflicts with the supporting departments’ procedures, leading to frequent clashes between the ‘cowboys’ and the ‘bureaucrats’. Nowhere is this more evident than in the implementation of ONE, or Our New Enterprise.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">ONE is a long-term project aimed at improving inventory management. With every scanner consisting of hundreds of thousands of parts, this is no task for the faint of heart. These components come from hundreds of different suppliers and are subject to continuous change – almost no chip machine is the same. The enterprise resource planning, or ERP, was based on software from the time of the Y2K bug. It was supposed to get a thorough update at a later date. Of course, this never happened.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This marked the birth of ‘Frankenstein’, as Peter Wennink calls the inventory system. It staggers its way through life at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, held together with nuts, bolts and confusing buttons.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">If a chip machine goes down in a fab, spare parts either need to be within reach or rushed immediately to the site. When this happens, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> pays a hefty premium to get priority on regular cargo flights. Other cargo is often hauled off to make space. However, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> frequently struggles with the sending of packages – the content is incorrect, wrong items are sent, and even empty boxes find themselves on an express trip around the world. It is a nightmare, just like Frankenstein’s monster.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">After other improvement programs fail, Veldhoven turns to ONE. In 2019, the Wilton division becomes the first to test the system. However, the American employees find themselves running headfirst into a bureaucratic wall. Parts that are actually in the warehouse are unable to be shipped due to a faulty registration. The response is usually the same: computer says no<span class="fft-cursief">.</span></p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Our New Enterprise clashes with the company’s deeply ingrained habits and shortcuts. ‘One half of the company is asking you to hurry up because a chip manufacturer urgently needs parts, while the other half wants you to follow all the rules,’ one exasperated employee complains. She has the unfortunate task of explaining to Martin van den Brink that, just because of some administrative obstacle with the<span class="fft-kk"> ONE </span>system, he needs to wait a few weeks for material from Wilton. Van den Brink is fuming. ‘Are you crazy?’ he responds. ‘You get in that car now and get that part out of the warehouse.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Just like the machines the company produces, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s planning is full of uncertainties. New factories and offices often turn out to be too small, and even the logistics center is cramped from the get-go. It is a recurring pattern. In 2013, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> built an <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> factory costing 600 million euros, but it turned out to need far more electricity and hydrogen then planned. New pipes had to be installed, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> flushed millions of euros down the drain fixing the mistake.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But guesswork seems an inescapable part of the process. Factories are built before it is certain how exactly the machines will work, or how many customers will order them. One thing <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> knows for certain: if you cover all the risks, you will never get a chip machine delivered on time. Every week counts when constructing a new cleanroom. If contractors in Veldhoven keep working during the nationwide three-week construction break <a id="_idTextAnchor063" class="calibre3"></a>in order to finish a factory, they receive a generous bonus.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> accepts that its organization does not always run optimally. Frits van Hout even has his own formula for this: ‘Things you do a thousand times of course need to be standardized. But if eliminating an inefficiency takes up so much time that it stops you from doing other, more important things, then you should just tolerate that inefficiency. As a good Calvinist, you might ask, “Could we not have prevented it?” But we say, just let it go.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is the kind of luxury a company in good shape can afford. In 2021, for example, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> made nearly six billion euros in profit – a 70 percent increase from the previous year.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But the accumulation of organizational problems that year forced <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to face some hard truths. ‘We have a blind spot for logistical blunders,’ Peter Wennink explains. ‘Because we can make <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>, we think we can do everything else too.’ The high-flyers can see technical obstacles in lithography systems from a mile away. But they will not wake up to logistical problems until customers start calling to ask, ‘Hey, where’s my machine?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This leads to the appointment of Wayne Allan as an extra board member in 2023. With his extensive operational background, Allan is given the job of improving procurement and managing the supply network. This move causes a shift in the balance between the ‘cowboys’ and the ‘bureaucrats’ in the boardroom. Van den Brink consistently positions himself as the champion of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s free technical culture, which he believes should never be allowed to get stuck by procedures and processes. The mere mention of KPIs, or key performance indicators, during a meeting is enough to send him storming out of the room. He finds it completely trivial – ‘I’ll be in the room next door talking about the actual content. Whoever wants to talk about KPIs can stay here.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> knows it needs to streamline its organization to save the whole operation from imploding again. After the trauma of 5L, Veldhoven initiated an ‘improved’ improvement program. <span class="fft-kk">BPI</span>, or Business Performance Improvement, is a new abbreviation for an old problem: how to handle the logistical web of constantly changing products spread out over a network of hundreds of suppliers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The plan is to approach inventory management the way <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> builds machines: with tight program management. Unsolvable problems can then be broken down into smaller parts with clear milestones. That is one way to tame the monster – at least in theory.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">BPI</span> project starts with the fundamentals of machine design, and so falls under the wing of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s technical director Martin van den Brink. Ultimately, he would also like to bring order to the chaos – so long as a little chaos remains.</p>
