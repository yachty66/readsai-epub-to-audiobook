			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Martin van den Brink snatches the microphone from the hands of the guide. ‘I got a little emotional,’ he later admitted – after all, he knew the place intimately, and there were stories he felt needed to be told. It is 2021, and along with a group of managers, Martin is taking a tour of the former Philips site in Eindhoven. Grasping the mic, he proceeds to tell the onlookers his own story. Gesturing towards a bench, he recounts sitting there in November 1983 after having applied for a role in the company. ‘Philips used to let applicants drive up to the entrance in a taxi, just so you felt that little bit more important,’ he recalled. ‘But I hated it. So I told them, “You enjoy yourselves, I’m gonna go do something else.” It was then that Wim Troost pulled out this leaflet for me to look at. “We’re going to start a new company. It will involve lithography and it won’t be called Philips anymore.” I took one look at the leaflet and knew immediately: that’s it. That’s what we’re gonna do. Just like that. Boom.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">That one impulse pulled the trigger for a long career at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. A talented engineer and influential project manager, Van den Brink quickly climbed to vice-president of technology in 1995. In 1999 he joined the board of directors while also heading the marketing department, and fourteen years later, he officially became president and chief technical officer. From then on, he wielded the final word on anything and everything <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> conjured up or brought to market.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Born in 1957, Martin van den Brink grew up in Bennekom, a small village in the province of Gelderland. His family had strong ties to the area: his parents were raised around the nearby Veenendaal, born into families of farmers from the Veluwe region. It’s a beautiful area, dotted with cows, pigs and an impressive number of churches, where schisms fracture the religious landscape. Bennekom itself lies at the heart of the Dutch Bible Belt, a stretch of largely conservative Christian communities that runs across the heart of the Netherlands. If visiting on a Sunday, you would be hard pressed to find a shop open in these parts.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">His father died young, suffering a heart attack when Martin was only nine years old. His mother raised the family as reformed Christians, and Martin, his sister and two brothers were told by the preacher from a young age that salvation was reserved only for God’s chosen few. But Martin was of a different persuasion: he saw the burden and sorrow that such ideas could lead to. ‘I hate it,’ ten-year-old Martin told a shocked group of elders during a house call, ‘and I can’t stand the long hours in church.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Instead, he sought his comfort in technology. Even in his early childhood, Van den Brink was curious about how things worked. He would buy his mum an assortment of devices for Mother’s Day, gifting clocks or electronic lighters – just what every mother wants. And as soon as she was out of the house, the tools appeared. The devices would be splayed out across the table, awaiting Martin’s fateful hand and probing screwdriver. And why not, he would think to himself as he resolutely drove the tool in. He just wanted to know how things were put together. After all, he had paid for it with his own savings.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">School was difficult for the curious boy. Dyslexic in a time of little support for special needs, Van den Brink carved his own path via three levels of engineering school. It was a long route, and every step took him further from home. First came a technical secondary school in the town of Ede. He then studied electronics at a technical college in Apeldoorn. Finally, young Martin found himself studying engineering and technology at a higher level in Arnhem. Here he specialized in power electronics, qualifying him to control industrial motors and systems. He cut his teeth on a hefty graduation assignment, writing optimization software for a project so complex his teacher had been unable to finish it himself. The extreme level of abstraction had him hooked. Far more so than studying physics, although he would later receive a degree in that subject from the University of Twente.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As a student he was fascinated by energy transfer to an almost obsessive degree. This led him to specialize in district heating, a sector seemingly far removed from the world of lithography. But when Wim Troost showed him the brand-new brochure of the <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 2000, his curiosity was piqued. The drive he had known from a young age struck him once more – this was a machine he wanted to get to the bottom of.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When he left for the south of the Netherlands to work at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, his mother asked one final time if he really needed to go. For her, leaving the region and going south of the rivers that divide the country was like moving a world away. But Martin was determined. The light of the machines in Veldhoven had lit a new path for the young man.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The second Martin stepped foot in the factory, Steef Wittekoek knew he had something special. Standing before him was an energetic and enthusiastic 27-year-old physicist, already an expert in electronics and mathematics. What more could he ask for? But as Wittekoek quickly found out, Martin was not one for restraint. The young <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’er could erupt at any moment if he felt someone was talking nonsense or beating around the bush. You never had to wait long to know exactly what Martin thought.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As far as Martin was concerned, engineering consisted of solving problems, not avoiding them. Doing the job properly meant seeking them out so they could be dealt with now rather than left to cause problems later. To this extent, he really was suited to be a physicist. For both physics and engineering the overriding priority is to find out why something does or does not work, even if it means asking difficult questions or breaking with accepted norms. Nothing is off limits: why is a certain number that number? Why not double or half?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">During technical discussions, Martin would probe the weak spots of every argument. He also had an uncanny sense for when someone was deflecting, never hesitating to confront them and pry them open, regardless of whether this was in front of colleagues, customers or suppliers. And if anyone thought they had a better idea – bring it on. You just had to be prepared for how it would be received if Martin thought otherwise. His second nature was to challenge the world around him, and this brazen and ruthless attitude would become one of the pillars of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Wittekoek took the unbridled young man under his wing, beginning a friendship that would at times resemble a father-son relationship. Steef could see that the loss of Martin’s father had made the boy self-reliant from an early age. He was an independent spirit – sometimes to his own detriment. Together they regularly attended the Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers (or <span class="fft-kk">SPIE</span>) conference in California; the meeting place for lithographers and companies from around the world to showcase their latest developments. The Dutch were fond of being recognizable at the conference, often donning colorful suits to stand out in the sea of gray and blue jackets. Martin was no different, never shying away from a pair of orange pants or a bright green tie with a suit to match. Initially Wittekoek led the presentations, until one year he let Martin take the lead. Unphased by the room full of potential clients, Martin did as Martin does: he provided brutally direct and honest replies to any questions that came his way.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s commercial boss was fuming. ‘That guy should never hold a presentation again, all he did was insult our customers.’ Martin, on the other hand, was annoyed at being regarded as just ‘some young boy’. They didn’t take the Dutch rookie seriously.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Over time, Wittekoek helped polish the young man, taking care to show Van den Brink that there was more to life than technology. You were allowed to enjoy the moments in between all the work: the social side of touring conferences, the dinners, a glass or two of wine after a long day. ‘He got to see that I had a life outside of my work, with my own family, and he noticed how much joy I got from that. For Martin at this time, that was an eye-opener.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the week following these <span class="fft-kk">SPIE</span> conferences, the pair would often visit<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> chip manufacturers, leaving the weekend free to go skiing in Idaho or Lake Tahoe. Standing at the top of a Black Diamond run, they always wondered if they would dare, or if they would even survive, before taking the plunge down the icy slopes.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Both Martin and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> were well suited for taking risks, Wittekoek believes. ‘We had our backs against the wall in our early days. It was all or nothing for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. And in those moments – this is something I did learn from Martin – sometimes you have to be hard on people to get results.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wittekoek saw the same drive and determination in Martin’s skiing. While Steef would gracefully carve his way round the slopes, respecting the path nature had offered, his young colleague would barrel over the mounds of snow with full force. When Martin saw the path he wanted to take, not even a mountain could stand in his way.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This sheer determination also came with its quirks. With his head in the clouds, he would often lose his boarding passes or leave his passport behind during trips. Martin didn’t seem to think much of these things. His mind was on more important matters. No trip was complete without someone running after him, delivering forgotten documents.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One such time, as Wittekoek and Van den Brink arrived at their hotel near Lake Tahoe, they hopped out of their rental car to quickly check in. The doors slammed shut, locking the car with the engine still running and the key in the ignition. Like good physicists, they were intrigued by the question of how long a stationary car could keep turning, after which they went to have a bite to eat and retired to their rooms. Only the next morning, when the engine appeared to still be running, did they call the rental company to ask if someone could come and open the car.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin frequently appeared to be in his own world. But what looked like absentmindedness from the outside was actually a remarkable ability to zero in and maintain focus on intractable technical problems, whether it be for hours, days, or even years.</p>
