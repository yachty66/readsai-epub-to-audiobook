			<p class="ff-platmetwit">It’s five in the afternoon in Hsinchu Science Park. Every time the traffic light turns green, a swarm of scooters leaves the <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> campus. They squeeze past trucks filled with gases and chemicals, as well as the construction traffic for ‘Fab 20’. That is the newest gigafactory, and from 2025 it will start producing chips to within an accuracy of 2 nanometers. It’s a massive installation that barely wedges between <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s other buildings.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">There are many ways to spot an employee from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company: the T-sticker on their scooter’s mudguard, the orange keychain around their neck, or the transparent bag they carry. The latter is mandatory to prevent people from smuggling out trade secrets. Taking your smartphone inside with you is not an option here.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The chip factory runs around the clock, with the production employees alternating in twelve-hour shifts. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> was aiming to hire an additional six thousand people in 2023, but with a birthrate as low as Taiwan’s, finding talent is a challenge. It now tries to attract high school students to work there for a few hours a week and become the latest recruits to the ‘<span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> army’, which already counts troops about seventy thousand strong. The Taiwanese chipmaker is a powerful link in the chip industry, manufacturing processors for Sony’s PlayStation, Apple’s iPhone and the graphic chips for the American chip manufacturer Nvidia, used for running artificial intelligence applications. In addition, Tesla and the datacenters from Amazon, Alibaba and Microsoft source their computing power from Taiwan. In 2022, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> supplied more than half of the world’s chips and 90 percent of the most advanced processors.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In light of the staggering costs of building a state-of-the-art chip factory, chip designers prefer to rent capacity from specialized ‘foundries’ like <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>. Even Intel outsources some of its production to the Taiwanese while its own <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> production isn’t running at full capacity.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Morris Chang, the brain behind <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s formula, is the embodiment of globalization. Born in 1931 in China, he studied mechatronics in the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and worked for Texas Instruments before moving to Taiwan. As previously mentioned, he started the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company with support from Philips in 1987. Since then, he has carried a black notepad in his pocket, always ready to write down new wafer orders. He’s also inseparable from his pipe and completely disregards the smoking ban in <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s offices, much to the surprise of the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers. No one dares to point it out.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Chang stepped down as <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> in 2005, but in 2009 he returned at the ripe old age of 78 to bring the company back on course. He disagreed with his successor Rick Tsai, under whose lead <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> produced chips for solar cells and <span class="fft-kk">LED</span> lighting. Chang wanted to capitalize on the mobile revolution. In 2013, he reeled in Apple as a customer, securing <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> a mega-order worth more than 3 billion euros in the process. Chang resigned from his position after the introduction of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> in June 2018, but has remained extremely influential well into his golden years. Taiwan may not be a monarchy, but this doesn’t stop foreign politicians from regarding Morris, the ‘king of chips’, as industrial royalty. He’s also a source of inspiration for Taiwanese entrepreneurs like Lisa Su and Jensen Huang, the leaders of successful American tech companies <span class="fft-kk">AMD</span> and Nvidia. They were both born in Tainan, the city where <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> now produces their chips.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Chang’s motto, in his own handwriting, is displayed on the wall at their headquarters in Hsinchu. Loosely translated, it reads: ‘Behind great obstacles, a bright future awaits.’ And there are plenty of them, as the four thousand <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers who work in Taiwan know all too well. Since <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> is the company at the forefront of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> technology, it is also the one exposing that technology’s problems.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In Martin van den Brink’s office sits a plaque from <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, that reads: ‘<span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>, April 2018’. It is his pride and joy. ‘That was the breakthrough,’ he remembers. ‘It all hinged on one thing: will it work, or will it fail?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It worked.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, in 2018 the new lithography machines were not working nearly as well as hoped. Mysterious particles that floated around in the machines were causing headaches and were decreasing the number of usable chips per wafer. And at <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, the yield is sacred: every fraction of a percent counts when you produce more than 15 million wafers annually, each containing several hundred advanced processors.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Because the lines in <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> are so extremely thin, any amount of contamination has consequences. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> keeps track of the number of errors that <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> discovers in a ‘particles per week’ tally. The Taiwanese practically explode with anger if tin particles end up on the mask. The fallout is immense: any mistake there is repeated on every wafer, with every step of the exposure. It is possible to cover the masks with a protective film, or ‘pellicle’, which keeps the particles at a distance and unable to do any harm. Think of it like a smudge on your sunglasses that you can still see through. But no matter how thin, this extra layer will always block out some valuable <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light, meaning it’ll take longer to expose the wafers. Every solution has its price in the world of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Thanks to the new machines, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> no longer needs to use double or triple exposures to draw fine lines on chips, at least for the time being. This saves money and time, but the learning curve is steep. It’s not an exact science, but rather a matter of trial and error, and adjusting accordingly. They gather data on ‘wafer movements’ from an early stage, as their data analysts use this information to improve the yield. To fill the database faster, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> also orders as many machines as possible from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. This kills two birds with one stone: every machine in Taiwan means one less for a competitor in South Korea. Veldhoven has limited production capacity, especially for the latest generation of scanners, and chip manufacturers gladly take advantage of this shortage.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s field engineers are up to their eyeballs in assisting <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> in optimizing the factory. At the same time, they have their work cut out for them convincing their colleagues in Veldhoven to help. Such discussions are often tense, and tempers flare between the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> departments. The designers in Veldhoven tend to suggest that <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> isn’t using the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>-machine properly, or that other machines in the chip factory are causing contamination. If a manager at <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> abruptly ends a Teams call in anger, the local <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> team knows it is up to them to pick up the pieces.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘<span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> has a good balance between helping and pushing,’ says Frits van Hout. The two companies come together quickly when it comes to sorting out technical problems. There’s a cultural click: Taiwanese people generally speak English well and have the same ‘outsourcing mentality’ as <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>: if someone else can do it better, let them do it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The culture at <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> is more hierarchical as compared to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, but less militaristic than in South Korea. The research departments bear the brunt of the workload, leaving their experts feeling that they are the ones doing the heavy lifting by helping <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> solve problems that will benefit their competitors down the line.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Hsinchu, located on the northwest coast of Taiwan, is <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s hub for working on new technology for chip production. Two groups of engineers, labeled the red and blue teams, take turns refining the new ‘nodes’. Once the new manufacturing technology is ready, the mass production of wafers in cities such as Tainan or Taichung can begin. This area used to be filled with rice fields and fruit trees, until the chip giant started planting megafabs and gigafabs. The noise they produce fills the entire area and sounds like a taxiing plane that never seems to take off.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Even though an <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine is about the size of a city bus, the associated construction spans several floors. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s main floor, which is more than 10 meters high, houses lithography systems, measuring equipment and other types of chip machines. Below it is the ‘sub-fab’ and the ‘sub-sub-fab’, with racks full of electronics, the laser, and machines that regulate handling of the cooling water, gases, and chemical components. You can see the impact of these <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines in the data on Dutch exports to Taiwan: between 2016 and 2022 the figure almost quadrupled from 3.1 to 11.6 billion euros. It is a hefty investment – but it pays off. Since 2019, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s yearly revenue has more than doubled to around 70 billion dollars. It now commands 60 percent of the entire foundry market, making it four times larger than its closest competitor, Samsung.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One key to the success in Taiwan lies in <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s strict separation of its clients. Engineers assisting one client, such as Apple, know nothing about the chips Nvidia makes. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> employees must also adhere to this strict confidentiality: explicit permission is needed to email any documents, and taking a quick photo of what was drawn on the board during a meeting is strictly prohibited. Some of the measurement data from the factory can be accessed remotely via a secure connection. There’s no time to waste on trivial trips to the cleanroom.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> can’t always fend off risks from the outside world. Dotted around the chip factory are red poles where <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> staff gather in case of emergencies. And the Taiwanese chip giant is far from immune to severe natural disasters. In September 1999, a powerful earthquake temporarily shut down the factories, and the subsequent chip shortage sent a financial shockwave throughout the industry.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">After every major earthquake – which Taiwan counts by the dozen every year – <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> technicians immediately rush into the factories to inspect the machines. The scanners have advanced air suspension to absorb the shocks, and these are incredibly sensitive. The system shuts itself down if the ground trembles too forcefully, which then means an entire reboot. Sometimes, simply hitting the power button is enough, just like reviving a frozen PC. But as soon as any one of the more than twenty indicator lights on the machine turns red, the whole system needs to undergo a thorough examination.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">About 40 percent of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s revenue comes from Taiwan. However, no matter how close the relationship between <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, the Taiwanese are not amused when the Dutch speak too extensively with other customers about the possibilities of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s top executives occasionally visit Qualcomm in San Diego, and Apple’s employees are known to stop by in Veldhoven every now and then. Because <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> wants to retain control, this only heightens their paranoia about potential leaks of technical knowledge.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Meanwhile, Taiwanese employees are regularly approached by Chinese tech companies like Huawei and <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>. They can easily earn three to five times their current salary in China, but would enjoy far fewer freedoms than in democratic Taiwan. The most prominent of them and one who does make the move is Liang Mong Song, the <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> research director who first leaked sensitive company secrets to competitor Samsung and then joined the Chinese competitor <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span> in 2017. In the eyes of his former colleagues, he committed a double betrayal, and it won’t be long before the rest of the world realizes how crucial Liang’s knowledge is to China’s expanding chip industry.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In addition, Taiwan faces a far greater threat from China. The Chinese Communist Party considers the island a renegade province, and with a single military action could annex or block the world’s most advanced chip factory. However, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> relies on Western knowledge and companies like <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, so the boycott that would occur after an annexation would lead to an acute shortage of fast semiconductors and plunge the global economy into turmoil, China’s included.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party will never risk this catastrophic scenario – or so the Taiwanese hope. They see the factories of Morris Chang as a ‘silicon shield’: as long as the world relies on computing power from Taiwan, the island is protected by the <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> army. That is the theory. In practice, economic logic rarely outweighs political interests in Xi Jinping’s China.</p>
