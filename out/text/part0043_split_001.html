			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span> makes no secret of doing business with the whole world. As soon as you walk into the headquarters in Veldhoven, you can see who is interested in a new lithography machine. If South Korean customers are visiting, you’ll see a South Korean flag sitting on the reception desk – next to the Dutch flag, of course. When Chinese companies visit, a Chinese flag will be waving to welcome them in. Nice gesture, no effort. For <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, all customers are equal. Only, the world doesn’t work like that anymore.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In China, new chip factories are rising up everywhere, helped by billions in state aid. In 2017, Chinese customers ordered 700 million euros’ worth of lithography machines. ‘A new record,’ Peter Wennink told his investors at the end of that year, predicting it to be ‘a very clear growth opportunity’ for them all. A few months later, Liang Mong Song, director of Chinese chip manufacturer <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>, signed on the dotted line in Shanghai for their first <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The supervisory board immediately pointed out the risks of this order. ‘Guys, we’re gonna have a problem here. The Americans won’t allow us everything.’ But the <span class="fft-kk">ASML </span>management brushed off the concerns: they do not do politics in Veldhoven, and they had already been delivering to China’s largest foundry, <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>, for years. Hundreds of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s scanners were running in the factories of this valued customer.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In November 2018, the top management scheduled a trip to China with the supervisory board. There, they met with the mayor of Shanghai, the Minister of Industry and Information Technology, and the chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission – the latter of which directly advises Xi Jingping.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Peter Wennink traveled to China often, five or six times a year. He knew that if you are talking to Chinese customers, you will also often end up talking to the Chinese government. Intellectual property was a sensitive topic in these interactions. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would only export its most advanced machine to China on one condition: under no circumstances should the valuable technology be copied. The Chinese officials assured him that the country would behave itself with regards to intellectual property rights, and even wanted to adapt its legal system accordingly. Wennink felt this was a shaky promise. However, he believed it was better to maintain dialogue and keep one foot in the door. Wennink was never one for burning bridges.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As he explained in January 2019, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> wanted to be part of China’s growth. ‘But as soon as we see flagrant infringement of our intellectual property, we’re done. No way China will catch up to<span class="fft-kk"> </span>us in the next ten or fifteen years. They’re light-years behind. Light-years!’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the time, Wennink was still confident that the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines could be shipped to China. He claimed he wasn’t experiencing any pressure from American politicians, despite mounting anti-China sentiments in Washington. ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> sticks to the law. We can ship to China because we get an export license from the Dutch government. So if there’s any pressure, it’ll be between governments.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And he was right. As soon as <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> applied for a Chinese export license in the Netherlands, the Americans kicked off their diplomatic campaign to keep <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> out of China. When the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Donald Trump met at the end of 2018 during the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, the <span class="fft-kk">‘ASML</span> question’ was raised. Rutte remained pragmatic: he didn’t want to be fazed by the chaos surrounding the American president. To him, it was more important to keep relations with the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> on good terms. Rutte’s strategy for talking to Trump: don’t mention the uproar. Be all smiles, and concentrate on ‘content’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Trump’s security adviser Tim Morrison subsequently made multiple trips to The Hague to speak with representatives of the Dutch government. The American diplomatic offensive was a joint effort by the departments of Defense and State, along with staff in the White House. Despite spending most of his time ridiculing international partnerships, Donald Trump decided to make an urgent appeal to the Netherlands on the basis of a multilateral agreement. According to Morrison, you would be wrong to think this was a case of the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> exerting pressure on friendly nations: ‘We all agree on how important <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> technology is. The Dutch government can take an independent decision on this matter.’ Though preferably a decision America agrees with.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">e<span class="fft-kk">UV</span> is controlled by the Wassenaar Arrangement, the multilateral export control regime on conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies. It was finalized in December 1995 in castle De Wittenburg in Wassenaar, an affluent town just outside The Hague. The negotiations went down to the wire; just before the celebratory dinner started, the French and the Russian delegates couldn’t agree on the final text. Their argument was solved at the very last minute, in a corner of the castle’s kitchen. In July 1996, the Arrangement became effective, and now 42 countries jointly regulate the export of sensitive technology. The Wassenaar Arrangement is the successor of <span class="fft-kk">COCOM</span>, a multilateral committee that, until 1993, aimed to prevent communist countries from gaining access to military technology. It is the reason <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> requires a permit.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Wassenaar Arrangement regulates the export of equipment that could be used for military purposes. This includes the most advanced lithography machines. Experts from participating countries gather annually in the Austrian capital of Vienna to determine which sensitive new technologies to add to the dual-use list. If the equipment becomes widely available, it can be removed from the list via consultation.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> granted <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> permission to acquire its American competitor <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> in 2001, the monopoly on <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> technology fell into Dutch hands. However, the Wassenaar Arrangement offers the Americans a way to influence which countries can use that technology. This would slow down Chinese innovation by limiting access to chips with a fineness of five or seven nanometers. If they wanted to manufacture processors on a large scale with even finer lines, they would need an <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Dutch cabinet found themselves wrestling with the issue: after all, this country had no choice but to be held accountable for its own tech giant. Although in principle Europe couldn’t help – in the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span>, export control legally is a matter for the individual member states – the pressure from their powerful ally America could not be ignored. Insiders described it as a ‘turd’ handed to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No matter how you handle it, you’ll come away with dirty fingers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The mess the Dutch found themselves in should not have come as a surprise. The Americans do not want an actual war with China, so instead seek to maintain control over Chinese technology by all other means. Chips are the oil of the modern economy, and if you follow the value chain, you quickly end up in Brabant – at exit 32 to Veldhoven-Zuid, to be precise.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Politics at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had traditionally been seen as a side issue. It came in handy for securing innovation subsidies or for arranging reduced working hours during times of crisis. But anything that diverted attention away from technology was considered unnecessary fuss and swiftly dismissed. This all changed in the summer of 2018 when the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> blocked the export of American chip machines to the Chinese memory chip manufacturer Fujian Jinhua. Because the matter stemmed from a dispute with Micron, it received less attention than the widely reported campaign on Huawei. Nonetheless, Veldhoven was shocked by this move from the Americans.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had already appointed a board member to strengthen government relations in early 2018, as other <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> countries had been grumbling about subsidies granted by Brussels to the prosperous <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. This board member was Frits van Hout, who represented <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s strategic interests with policy makers through his government affairs team from 2018 until his retirement in 2021. When he saw his workload suddenly increase due to geopolitical tensions, he realized that a new game was unfolding.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">According to Van Hout, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is not diplomatic by nature: ‘We’re very direct. If we mean no, then we’ll say no. And yes is yes. End of story. Governments have to get used to that.’ But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> also had to get used to governments – sometimes, they also say no. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> may dominate the market for the most important chip machines, but it no longer determines its own fate.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This still causes a huge amount of resistance. In Veldhoven’s eyes, the people who make the rules don’t understand how ‘it’ works – ‘it’ being the entire chip industry, with all its global dependencies, vulnerable supply chains and complex technology. It is a world that revolves around mutual trust, long-term agreements and free-market dynamics. The government cannot be allowed to disrupt this fragile ecosystem: most of all because <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> makes a lot of money from it, including in China, and it creates many jobs in the Netherlands.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> claims the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> is mainly using the blockade of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> to feed its own economic war against China. The technology is for manufacturing advanced semiconductors in larger volumes, with fewer tricks and fewer mistakes. These are chips for phones, not for fighter jets. As far as Veldhoven is concerned, fears about <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> being used for military applications are baloney – the weapons industry uses proven lithography techniques that have been on the market for years. In addition, most chips found in weapons are ‘off-the-shelf’ chips that can also be found in laptops, washing machines or cars, and are easy to purchase anywhere in the world.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> sees things differently. The American definition of ‘military’ goes far beyond conventional weapons. They fear the emergence of Chinese artificial intelligence, the Chinese supercomputers that are dominating the global rankings and the arsenal of superior cyber weapons that will be at Beijing’s disposal. And there is one thing those all need: advanced chips.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Until 2021, decisions about the export license for <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> were the responsibility of the Minister of Foreign Trade, Sigrid Kaag. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> traditionally enjoyed a far better relationship with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, which between 2017 and 2021 was led by Eric Wiebes. However, he was preoccupied with the damage being caused by earthquakes related to gas extraction in the province of Groningen, so at the beginning of 2018 he handed over his industrial portfolio to State Secretary Mona Keijzer. Ultimately, her ministry had little say over export licenses. It could only advise, and via the embassy in Washington it tried to mitigate damage caused by the Trump administration’s string of anti-China measures.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The final decision on the export license for <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> rested on Mark Rutte’s third cabinet, in which the intelligence services, along with the Ministries of Justice and Security, Defense and General Affairs, outrank the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This ministry traditionally championed a hands-off approach towards businesses, allowing them to take full advantage of world trade. As a neoliberal trading nation, the Netherlands rode the wave of globalization for over thirty years. This also meant they turned a blind eye to China’s rise, preferring to defer the thorny political decisions to its companies. In the words of a Dutch diplomat, ‘You could call that naïve, but it’s earned<span class="fft-kk"> </span>us an unbelievable amount of money.’ <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is the embodiment of that mercantile spirit.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, the Dutch perspective <a id="_idTextAnchor039" class="calibre3"></a>on China was shifting. In May of 2019, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a critical report on China, titled, ‘A New Balance’. This report stated that China was guilty of engaging in unfair trade practices, cyber-espionage, and theft of technology. It also noted the deteriorating human rights situation, and raised questions about China’s ambitions to become a world leader in artificial intelligence. The report doubted the feasibility of ‘Made in China 2025’, but it expressed a deep unease about where this might end: the emergence of China as a technological and scientific superpower that operates by its own rules, free from international conventions.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One year later, in June 2020, Dutch intelligence services warned of espionage attacks from China aimed at semiconductor companies. This came as no surprise: the high-tech sector had already been a target for years. For example, at the beginning of 2015, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> found itself subject to a cyber-attack when hackers gained access to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s network through an account from their subsidiary Brion in Shenzen. An employee in San Diego smelled trouble as soon as the networks of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and Cymer were connected: someone was trying to get in with the wrong password. Alarm bells started ringing. Was there something wrong? Over in Veldhoven, it turned out there was.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Multiple security firms were brought in to assess the damage, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s facilities in the United States also received a thorough examination. The investigation by these response teams, akin to a force of digital firefighters, went on for weeks. The hackers had built a backdoor and gained access to usernames and passwords, from which they had started to transfer captured information in zip files via computer addresses in Japan. The security experts were convinced that Chinese hacking groups knew what they were searching for: documents about lithography machines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A team of officials from the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (<span class="fft-kk">AIVD</span>) made an unsolicited appearance in Veldhoven. They received a cold reception, as <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> felt the <span class="fft-kk">AIVD</span>’ers were just there to be nosy, especially when the intelligence services’ cybersecurity specialists suggested <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was too lax about the risks of economic espionage.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The breach brought the company face-to-face with a harsh reality. In 2015, the security of their networks was grossly inadequate. A new cybersecurity team took it upon itself to ‘raise the dikes’ and started to increase its collaboration with the <span class="fft-kk">AIVD</span>. As a primary target, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has proven to be a valuable source of information for the intelligence services. When you keep a close eye on Veldhoven, you can learn a lot about the attack methods and capabilities of Chinese hacking groups.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Cymer was acquired in May 2013, and the breach was reported by the website <span class="fft-cursief">Tweakers</span> in early 2015. In theory, the hackers could have been snooping around the company network for a considerable amount of time. According to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, the breach was quickly halted, and there was no evidence that any valuable information was stolen. A brief press release stated, ‘We cannot be certain about the identity of the hackers,’ but one thing was for sure: <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s servers had found themselves on the frontline of the cyberwar.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span> long tried to avoid the geopolitical stage. In retrospect, Frits van Hout believes it was naïve to think they could avoid that dance. You cannot operate outside the spotlight forever when your machines print the building blocks of the modern world.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In January 2020, the diplomatic fencing finally became public. Reuters news agency reported that the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> had asked the Netherlands to block <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> exports, and suddenly <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> found itself in the spotlight. The combination of Trump’s trade war, the espionage cases and the debate over Huawei and 5<span class="fft-kk">G</span> created a whirlwind of publicity, and Veldhoven became front page news.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As long as the export license remained officially ‘under consideration’, China would be unable to access <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines. Minister Sigrid Kaag encouraged <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to explain this to the Americans so they would ease off their campaign, but the Trump administration was a challenge to deal with. Several online meetings with nearly twenty participants were arranged, with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Dutch embassy in Washington on one side and representatives from<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> departments on the other. No cameras, no introductions, just an impersonal barrage of questions.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Meanwhile, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> kept on turning up the heat. In October 2020, a confidential analysis written by the Dutch Ministry of Defense detailed how it had received ‘an urgent plea from its most important strategic partner.’ Its warning: with access to <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> lithography, the Chinese defense industry could develop smarter algorithms for missiles, drones, and cyber warfare.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Netherlands ultimately denied <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> a license based on this advice, but it made sure to do so in terms that didn’t explicitly prohibit delivery to China. Despite the diplomatic packaging, the result was still the same: no <span class="fft-kk">EUV </span>machine was going to <span class="fft-kk">SMIC</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Rutte hoped this perpetual pause button would satisfy both superpowers. The Americans were pleased, but kept their sights trained on the Netherlands. If <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> were to unexpectedly get an export license for <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>, they had a plan B ready to fire. ‘The bullet is in the chamber,’ as one of Trump’s hawks said in November 2020, one of the hardliners pushing the tough stance on China.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> always has a so-called ‘de minimis’ rule in its back pocket. Like the sword of Damocles, this rule hovers over the entire international chip industry. As soon as there is even a scrap of American technology in a machine, the Department of Commerce can impose a licensing requirement on the entire device. The bar is normally set at 25 percent American technology: if it were lowered to 10 percent or less, it would put <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in difficult waters.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine consists of around 90 percent European technology, so it escapes falling under American export regulations. The scanners do have a light source that is partly made in San Diego – think of Joann’s hands soldering nozzles or the droplet generator that regularly needs to be replaced.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> wanted to know – down to the very last screw – what is put into a lithography machine, and the final destination of each component. To twist <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s arm, American officials refused on several occasions to approve deliveries of spare materials from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> intended for desperate chip manufacturers. Behind this tactic was the powerful National Security Council, which was fishing for a detailed list of components.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">On behalf of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, Dutch diplomats objected to this underhand approach. It was verging on blackmail, and even members of the National Security Council questioned if this was any way to treat an ally. When it comes to China, apparently it was.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> reluctantly compiled a list, but added enough creative ambiguities to render it useless. One of the American experts chasing it later admitted that the <span class="fft-kk">NSC</span> had a weak case anyway.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In 2020, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s annual revenue share coming from China was dwindling. Due to the restrictions on China, more of the high-cost <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines were now being sold to Taiwan and South Korea, which increased the proportion of revenue coming from outside of China. The Netherlands was not the only country to face issues following the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> ban: after pressure from the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, Korean manufacturer<span class="fft-kk"> SK </span>Hynix was forced to back out after it ordered an extreme ultraviolet machine for a Chinese factory in Wuxi. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s second <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> license application was also scrapped.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Peter Wennink watched with regret as his company missed out on a potential market for significant growth. Even though his company had been forced to slam on the brakes in China, the Americans were putting their foot on the gas and capitalizing on their share of the trade. Chinese chip manufacturers were still able to produce more advanced chips with conventional <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> machines by using multi-patterning techniques. This involves executing multiple exposures in succession: imagine a printing press that doubles the number of words on a page by printing extra sentences between the lines of the initial print. However, this trick requires more advanced depositing and etching machines, and this technology mainly comes from American chip machine manufacturers like Applied Materials, <span class="fft-kk">KLA</span>, and Lam Research. Those<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> companies were happy to see Veldhoven lose ground in China if it meant they would not miss out on revenue themselves. You can put a price tag on it: in a chip factory that uses <span class="fft-kk">DUV </span>scanners and multi-patterning, 20 percent of the total investment goes to lithography machines. For <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> instead of multi-patterning, it is 30 percent. Considering a new fab can cost around 15 billion dollars, the stakes are high.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> affair prompted <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to strengthen its ties with governments by forging closer collaborations with ministries in The Hague and the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Department of Commerce, as well as establish its own representation in Brussels and Washington, <span class="fft-kk">DC</span>. In addition, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> built its own lobbying team in the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> so it no longer had to solely rely on the Semiconductor Industry Association, the primary voice of American chip companies.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">By the end of 2023, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s lobbying expenses in the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> had grown from virtually zero to 1.4 million dollars. To compare, industry counterpart Applied Materials spent 2 million dollars that year to influence policies in Washington. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> also increased its annual lobbying costs in Brussels sixfold to 300,000 euros. Although these budgets are still modest compared to other tech giants, one thing is clear: for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, politics is no longer a side show.</p>
