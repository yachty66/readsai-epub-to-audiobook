			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6" class="ff-kopx"><span class="fft-kleiner1"><a id="_idTextAnchor000" class="calibre3"></a>Prologue: <br class="calibre2"/></span>A Starry Sky</h1>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The band signals to dim the lights. The most magical moment of the evening is about to begin.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-cursief">“Can you shine your lights?”</span></p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Of course. In the blink of an eye, phones light up in every corner of the room, waving back and forth in a sea of invisible hands. It’s one big starry sky.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Imagine how enchanting it would be if the band got all the smartphones in the world to light up at the same time. That’s almost seven billion phones – 85 percent of the world’s population has one. This gives you an idea of the scope of the company this book is about.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Now, whatever you had in mind, think bigger. An even vaster starry sky is possible. Imagine the band gets every chip, in every device in the world, to light up.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-cursief">Everybody, shine your lights!</span></p>
			<p class="ff-plat">They glow: every chip in every laptop, every Wi-Fi router, and every cell phone tower. The chips in every car, traffic light, washing machine and smartwatch, every pair of headphones, coffee machine, camera and TV monitor in the world. The chips in all the data centers, factories, hospitals, control towers, planes, trains, power plants and windmills. The chips in the cruise missile searching for its target and in the radar trying to intercept it. The chips in the supercomputers deciphering a new infectious virus and in the servers of the data center creating a vaccine to fight it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">All the chips that track your online behavior, carry out your search queries, file your tax returns and play your favorite music and videos. The chips that predict the weather and tell you how many steps you’ve taken, how many messages you’ve missed, where your daughter is hanging out this time.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And finally, the memory chips light up. An infinite digital memory, home to all your emails, apps, photos and videos from the past ten or twenty years. Kilobytes became megabytes, megabytes became gigabytes, gigabytes became terabytes. An explosion of data.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Deleting photos or cleaning up your mailbox doesn’t make a difference – the world has enough chips to store all your data. Right?</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Every year, manufacturers such as Intel, <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and Samsung produce billions of chips, each of which consists of billions of switches. These are semiconductors, miniature constructions built on a silicon disc or wafer. You wouldn’t give at silicon in its raw sand-like state a second glance. However, once processed, it has the capacity to alter conductive properties, which means you can use it to turn electric currents on or off – in other words, to transform a ‘0’ into a ‘1’. Silicon Valley, the birthplace of the chip industry, owes its name and fame to this unique material.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Nowadays, the vast majority of these chips are made using the machines of one company: <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. But don’t let that fool you: four decades ago, this Dutch enterprise was nothing more than forty employees, an experimental device and a hopeless business plan. They had no idea their invention would play a key role in an industry now worth over 600 billion dollars a year.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And demand keeps growing. In 2030, the turnover of the chip industry is expected to be more than one trillion dollars. By that time, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s yearly revenue will have also doubled from 27 billion euros in 2023 to 40, 50 or – according to the most optimistic forecasts – 60 billion.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As of 2023, this makes <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> Europe’s most valuable high-tech company. It has 42,500 employees across over 60 locations in 16 different countries, a global operation with only one goal in mind: to maintain total dominance of the lithography machinemarket. These machines are the hypercomplex devices chip manufacturers use to produce their chips, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is not only responsible for over 90 percent of the supply, but also has a monopoly on the most cutting-edge technology. It is better to think of these machines as ‘systems’: to give you an idea of scale, it takes seven Boeing 747s to transport <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s most advanced tool to a chip factory. The units may be large, but they are extremely fragile. The separated parts of the machine need specifically designed metal incubators to keep the sensitive equipment at exactly the right temperature during its travels.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But what is this machine, and how does it work? In short, a lithography machine prints intricate patterns onto a photosensitive silicon wafer. It is basically a super-precise projector which casts the same image onto the same wafer hundreds of thousands of times at lightning speed until, step by step, photo by photo, a wafer full of chips starts to form. By the end, each of these chips will house billions of tiny integrated circuits. This painstaking process can take months, with each chip consisting of potentially hundreds of different layers that all need to be perfectly aligned, one on top of the other. The slightest deviation is enough to ruin a whole production line of chips. Hundreds of thousands of dollars can turn into a lump of worthless silicon, all in the blink of an eye, or the flash of a machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The more fine-grained the light such a machine can project, the more transistors – miniature electrical switches in a chip – will fit onto the same surface. And the more transistors, the faster, more efficient and more powerful the chip. Back in the ’60s Gordon Moore, co-founder of the chip manufacturer Intel, was paying close attention to this process. He noticed a recurring pattern: approximately every two years, the number of transistors that could fit on a chip doubled. Moore adjusted his prediction over the years, but there was no going back. His observation had ignited the imagination of scientists and engineers the world over and became known as Moore’s Law. Computing power and digital storage continued to become cheaper and more energy-efficient, and with it the number of applications for chips grew: from computers and servers to phones and wireless gadgets, to sensors for just about every conceivable device. Whether natural law, self-fulfilling prophecy, or fiction, the result is just the same.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">If you look closely, you can still see it at play today: the phone in your pocket costs a few hundred dollars, but has more processing power than all the computers used by <span class="fft-kk">NASA</span> for the first moon landing combined. In 2013, Apple’s fastest laptop had a central processing unit with just over one billion transistors. By the end of 2023, that number was 92 billion. Gordon Moore may have passed away, but his law is still holding up.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">As the circuits on the chips shrink, the machine that produces them grows. A modern lithography machine is comprised of over 100,000 components, all working together in a tightly coordinated dance. As the <span class="fft-cursief">New York Times</span> wrote in 2021, ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s machine is the most complicated machine in the world,’ and the size of a city bus.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">That was then. The latest series of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> machines are even more impressive: they’re the size of a steam locomotive and capable of aiming one tiny beam of invisible light with an accuracy of 1 nanometer, or one millionth of a millimeter. This latest version isn’t quite finished yet, but the first machines have already been sold. The price: almost 400 million euros. But for all the specifications and descriptions in the world, nothing can prepare you for entering one of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s dust-free cleanrooms and seeing one of these things up close. The sheer size of the separate modules is enough to take your breath away. Meters-high metal frames, shiny tubes and pipes, fist-thick cables, heavy magnets and intricate mechatronics. It feels like you’re walking on the set of a science fiction movie, but with one difference: this machine really exists.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Despite the best efforts of competitors such as Nikon and Canon, no one has been able to keep up with the technological advances made in Veldhoven, the small Dutch town that is home to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. This has left the chip industry heavily dependent on the Dutch company. The lithography machine is the most important piece of equipment in any chip factory, and without doubt the biggest investment in a facility that can set you back 15 billion dollars to build. It is easy to see why working at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is known to come with a little pressure.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As the world continues to digitize – for the energy transition, a less polluting industry, better medical care or more powerful weapons – the demand for chips is exploding. And <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has to grow at the same pace, just as explosively. It is a constant drive to attract and house new staff, integrate hundreds of new employees each month, and manage the ever-expanding logistics as well as a network of hundreds of suppliers who have to deliver more for increasingly complicated devices. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has now itself become a hypercomplex machine, difficult to manage and in need of constant maintenance. A reminder that even the most complicated technology still relies on people.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">For a long time, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was able to operate in the shadows: it was just some obscure high-tech company busy developing incomprehensible machines that balanced on the edge of the impossible. Every conceivable scientific discipline was needed to harness the natural forces released in the lithography machine. Optics, mechatronics, physics, chemistry – and all with the aid of complex algorithms which themselves require enormous computing power. Fodder for nerds and scientists, but not something for the front pages. Until the politicians got involved.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The strategic interest in the chip industry is hard to exaggerate. Sixty years after the invention of the microprocessor, the entire world runs on chips. They are an indispensable resource for all aspects of modern society. And thanks to the pandemic, international superpowers such as the United States, China and the <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> are now keenly aware how dependent they are on chips for their prosperity and security. The moment they’re gone, you notice.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The computers in Microsoft’s Dutch data center sing in perfect unison. Their eerie hum fills the Middenmeer polder, reverberating from the racks full of servers blasting their warm air into your face. As you step closer, the note becomes clear. It’s a pitch-perfect high B.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘You’re hearing the <span class="fft-kk">GPU</span>s,’ says a maintenance worker. ‘Those are the graphics chips that run the artificial intelligence software.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The tone drops in the next hall, filled with data servers. Here, the buzz is closer to a low <span class="fft-kk">E</span>. It’s a chorus of computers, as far as the eye can see.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In this data center alone, Microsoft replaces 3,000 servers with new equipment every month. A costly but necessary precaution: if these servers go down, so does the cloud. The service relies on users being able to trust that this global network of the largest data centers, known as hyperscalers, is fully functioning twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. They cannot be allowed to falter.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Despite the name, the cloud is closer to the ground than you might think. As a user, you only see the little magic icon on your screen that you tap to start your game, download your apps or bombard your colleagues with emails. Not many imagine that it is actually tucked away in a drab Dutch polder landscape. But for the longest time, no one had to think about the reality of what these services rely on. It was just business as usual. Until an invisible virus shut down the world.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">At the beginning of 2020, the coronavirus pandemic spread across the planet. Lockdowns or not, there was no stopping it. Borders closed, and shops and companies had to shut down. Wearing facemasks and keeping your distance were the only remedies while the wait for a vaccine continued.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As public life ground to a halt, the digital world kept running. However, it faced a whole new set of hurdles. Everyone was suddenly working from home and wanted to video conference at the same time, which left the Microsoft cloud constantly battling malfunctions. Relatively unknown apps like Zoom and Teams were thrust into the spotlight as their usage exploded. The amount of data the world produced shot up exponentially, forcing Microsoft’s data center in Middenmeer to bring in trucks filled with racks of thousands of extra servers. It was the only way to keep the Teams sessions running. With all the extra computing power, extra memory and extra <span class="fft-kk">GPU</span>s, the high B was reaching a crescendo.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The sudden increase in demand for chips sparked a series of unforeseen consequences. It hit more than just servers for data centers; laptops, screens, game consoles and Wi-Fi routers started flying off the shelves at a rate far quicker than they could be restocked. Billions of schoolchildren and employees were forced to work from home and depended on their online connection, whether they liked it or not. Lockdowns kept the world glued to the couch, sending Netflix usage through the roof and keeping game servers working overtime. All services reliant on cloud computing.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Shortages arose in other sectors requiring processors, sensors and memory chips, with the car industry hit the hardest. Car manufacturers scaled back their orders to chip factories in early 2020, expecting the coronavirus crisis to dampen demand for cars. But this turned out to be a huge mistake. As soon as the market recovered, the automotive industry found it was <a id="_idTextAnchor001" class="calibre3"></a>actually in need of more chips to keep up with the transition from combustion engines to electric vehicles. Every new car has more than a hundred processors and thousands of separate chips, the electronics alone make up a staggering 40 percent of the production costs for each vehicle. It was the wrong time to hit the brakes.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With the chip factories running at full capacity due to the pandemic, new orders from the car manufacturers ended up at the back of the queue. The pinch of the chip shortage was starting to be felt. By the end of 2020 there were no longer enough chips for digital dashboards, driving assistants or airbag sensors, and the first production lines came to a standstill. Toyota, <span class="fft-kk">VW</span>, Nissan, Renault, <span class="fft-kk">GM</span>: everyone had to put part of their production on pause.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Anyone who ordered a new car had to wait for more than a year. Or settle for a model with an old fashioned handle to crank down the windows rather than a button. Muscle power instead of chips, just like the olden days.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Back in the south of the Netherlands, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was on the receiving end of a flurry of anxious calls. It was the end of 2020, and in his office on the twentieth floor Martin van den Brink had just finished a Teams conversation with his biggest customer, the Taiwanese chip manufacturer <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>. The message was clear: <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> was angry.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink has been <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s technical director and an employee from day one. As Veldhoven’s chief strategist and technical conscience, he has spent the last forty years charting the path for the company to follow. And when the shit really threatened to hit the fan, he was the one you would turn to: the highest and most feared rung in <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s ladder of escalation.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The person on the other end of the line was Wei-Jen Lo, senior vice president of research and development at <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>. The pandemic had presented him with an impossible task: his company was responsible for supplying half of the world’s processors, and around 90 percent of the fastest ones. Everyone was aware of their dependence on Taiwanese chip production, and in this time of scarcity it was beginning to cause friction.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> had the world breathing down its neck. Angry politicians wanted their car industries up and running: Germany’s Chancellor Merkel had called to ask for chips to be delivered more quickly to the German car industry, while <span class="fft-kk">US</span> President Joe Biden was demanding that <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> give priority to American car factories. And on their end, the Taiwanese company was pressuring <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to help expand their plant’s capacity, and quickly. ‘We need more productivity, Martin. More machines and higher output. Otherwise, we’re finished.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Angry chip manufacturers were a dime a dozen in the life of Van den Brink. By this point he had experienced so many crises in the chip industry there was not much left that could faze him. But this was different. The pandemic threw production chains into chaos. Even the chips that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and its suppliers needed to produce the machines that could make the chips were no longer available. The chip shortage was biting itself in the tail.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">a<span class="fft-kk">SML</span> had also been forced to switch to remote working. At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis the Dutch high-tech company ordered 20,000 extra Teams licenses from Microsoft, allowing it to support the global network of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> technicians with their onerous task of keeping 5,000 lithography systems running. The world had realized just how much it relied on the chips these machines produce. Everyone needed them to keep stamping chips.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink still harbors a deep hatred for remote meetings. ‘I need to know how you’re feeling, how you’re holding yourself, how you look and what you’re looking at. I want to read people.’</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Peter Wennink’s office is right across the hall from Martin’s. Peter became <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> in 2013 after fourteen years as financial director, and is also co-chair of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s board of directors together with Van den Brink. Two opposing personalities, united in joint leadership. ‘They’re like yin and yang,’ according to a supervisory board member. ‘They complement each other perfectly.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For a long time, the company only had the laws of nature to reckon with. But since 2018, it has found itself subject to a new realm: the unpredictable machinations of geopolitical forces. And this is where Wennink shines. Peter is <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s face for the outside world: if you’re a shareholder or politician, the first thing you’ll remember about Veldhoven will be his welcoming yet firm handshake. And it’s on him to keep the ship steady and guide <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> through this geopolitical storm. It is an endless task: lobbying in Washington, strategic planning in The Hague, shaking hands in Brussels, giving guided tour after guided tour of Veldhoven. After all, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is no longer some ‘relatively obscure’ company (in the words of a <span class="fft-kk">BBC</span> journalist) – it is global front-page news.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">China is on the heels of the Western world. The <span class="fft-kk">US</span> wants to keep them at bay technologically by preventing them from setting up independent chip production using <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s machines. The Americans see this as a direct threat to their national security: as far as they’re concerned, every chip produced by China could be used for military aims. In the face of this existential threat, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> has become deeply committed to maintaining its lead in the fields of artificial intelligence and complex weapon systems, giving the semiconductor industry little choice but to go along with this.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Trump administration may have set up the play, but President Biden pulled the trigger when he brought in tighter export regulations to freeze the Chinese technological advance. However, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> knows this is not enough. It needs its allies to go along with these export restrictions, in particular the Netherlands – and that means <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The chip machine manufacturer may have grown up in an era of globalization, but that time has long passed. The fault lines of the world are clear, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has no choice but to consider where it stands. When it comes to strategic readjustments like these, there’s no manual or playbook to fall back on. The choices you make are your own.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The pandemic laid bare the vulnerability of the supply chains of the West. Attention has shifted to Taiwan, the island just off mainland China where <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> operates its factories. Dependence on <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> is the Achilles’ heel of the worldwide tech sector, and the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and <span class="fft-kk">EU</span> are deeply anxious about it. Both have thrown billions into developing chip factories on home soil in recent years in an attempt to reduce this dependency.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Peter Wennink knows <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is the beating heart of this strategy. In 2023 alone, chip manufacturers planned more than 300 billion dollars worth of new factories. The company helped shape the European Chips Act, and Wennink was the guest of honor with a front row seat at the opening of <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s new factory in Phoenix, Arizona. As the first chip machine was hoisted inside in December 2022, even this mammoth device was dwarfed by the ‘Made in America’ flag flying from the façade.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Yet, he downplays his role on the world stage juggling two rival superpowers: ‘No one is really important. At most, there are just positions with a lot of responsibility.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When Wennink shook hands with President Joe Biden and Apple <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> Tim Cook, the largest purchaser of <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>’s chips, in the Arizona desert, he was indifferent about the fact that it said “Wennick” on the name tag dangling from his neck. ‘Wennick, Winnick … I’ve seen all the variations.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The American media and politicians do not seem to be bothered by it either, but for a different reason. They have no idea who he is to begin with. Everyone is perplexed by the mysterious tall man shaking the hand of the president. ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>? What kind of company is that?’</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">This book is the story of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. It is the tale of the two top executives who, over the course of several decades, led their company to unimaginable heights. On the one hand you have Martin van den Brink: the brilliant technician who designs the most precise machines on earth, with a confrontational style of management that lies somewhere between cross-examination and shock therapy.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Martin puts the fear of God in you,’ says Wennink. It even took him a couple of years to get used to it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And on the other hand, you have Peter Wennink: ‘Peter loves to cut a ribbon,’ teases Van den Brink, as his fellow <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> hosts yet another group of politicians at the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> headquarters. He grins – he’s not cut out for such formalities. He’s too direct for diplomacy.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Peter is a non-engineer leading a high-tech company, a people person. He manages to keep a handle on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s nonconformist high-tech culture and hold together the crucial network of suppliers. He is at the center of every web, and it’s the reason his word carries the power to move the share price of one of the world’s most valuable tech companies. He is also the person who came up with the plan to finance <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s biggest technological leap – the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine – jointly with the chip manufacturers. It is thanks to this advance that Moore’s Law will continue to apply for years to come.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In the span of forty years, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has grown into a dominant market leader, an industrial powerhouse expanding so fast the humble Dutch province it still calls home can barely keep up. But it is not planning on moving – it is on everyone else to keep up with the marching pace of the high-tech giant living in their backyard. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> doesn’t often hear no, let alone accept it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">At the turn of 2024, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is preparing to enter a new phase. Wennink’s and Van den Brink’s contracts will run out, and the two 67-year-olds on the same salary (5.94 million euros in 2023) will step back when they do. Although <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has been working on their succession behind the scenes for years, theirs will be a hard act to follow.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin and Peter may be nothing alike in character. At all. But over the course of endless meetings, negotiations, trips and walks in the Kampina nature reserve by Veldhoven, they came to understand each other. They developed a mutual respect for what made them different, and once they combined their formidable skillsets, they became unstoppable.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Together, they helped build a company that overcame crisis after crisis by never losing sight of one key thing: focus.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Because in the world of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, focus is everything. And it has been from the very beginning.</p>
