			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Mona Keijzer doesn’t like being the bearer of bad news, especially right before Christmas. But this time, she has no choice. The Dutch State Secretary for Economic Affairs steps out of her service car and rushes through the revolving door of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s headquarters in Veldhoven. On the twentieth floor, she tells the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> board what she was unable to say over the phone: ‘We have a problem with the Americans. It’s about Mapper. The Pentagon… you need to help us!’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In December of 2018, the diplomatic lines between Washington, The Hague, and Veldhoven were bustling with activity. Even before the tech war between the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> and China erupted in full force on the international frontpages, a completely different game was being played behind closed doors. It concerned Dutch chip technology at risk of falling into Chinese hands.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It was all down to Mapper, the company based in Delft that had been working on e-beam, or electron beam technology, since 2000. Electrons allow you to write intricate patterns on chips, and with its so-called multibeam technology, Mapper had a technical marvel on its hands. But it was difficult to sell. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> had tried out a Mapper machine in 2010 and concluded that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s lithography machines were better suited for the mass production of chips. No need for electrons: you could replicate a chip pattern all at once using photons – light, that is. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> opted for <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> and returned the machine to Delft.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Mapper had to switch lanes, fell into acute financial trouble and ultimately went bankrupt at the end of 2018. As a result, valuable knowledge came up for grabs. It may not have been a commercial success, but the technology from Delft was strategically important. And this made the Pentagon uneasy.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">On January 28, 2019, one and half months after Mona Keijzer knocked on Veldhoven’s door, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> acquired the intellectual property of the bankrupt Mapper and snapped up all its highly qualified employees left out in the cold. What the press release failed to mention was how much <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> paid for the bankrupt estate, nor did it tell the unbelievable story that preceded it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">That story begins in America.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">When GlobalFoundries pulled the plug on its <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> program in 2018, it confirmed the American defense specialists’ fears that the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> had lost its grip on the fastest chips. The Pentagon saw a problem looming. The<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Department of Defense wanted the majority of modern chips to be made on American soil, under<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> supervision. The term for this principle is trusted foundry, and for the Americans, it was a strategic necessity. If the chips for F-35 fighter jets, advanced drones, or equipment for the secret services came from factories abroad, they would be far more vulnerable to sabotage or hacks.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The combination of GlobalFoundries’ discontinuation and Intel failing to keep up with the Asian chip manufacturers had put the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> at a disadvantage. For the Pentagon, that was unacceptable. In 2018,<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> defense specialists held discussions with <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> and Samsung. These companies were willing to build more advanced chip factories in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, but in return they requested three to eight billion dollars in state aid – far more than the Pentagon had available. But then, a high-tech gift from Delft popped up on the radar: Mapper.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Mapper was conceived at the Delft University of Technology, when Pieter Kruit, a professor in charged particle optics, asked his students to design a system for electron beams that could be applied in commercial lithography. Excited by the possibilities of this technology, two of his students, Bert Jan Kampherbeek and Marco Wieland, started their own company in 2000 after they graduated under Kruit. Wieland was the driving force behind the technology, while Kampherbeek was focused on the business end. As always, this meant needing to raise money to keep the business afloat.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Mapper was co-financed by Arthur del Prado, and once again the pioneer of the Dutch chip industry was at the forefront, helping to advance a technology with potential. Even though a lack of funds had forced him to withdraw from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in 1988, he never lost his eye for promising semiconductor technology.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With Mapper’s approach, the expensive masks were no longer needed. The chip pattern, several terabytes in size, came from computer memory and was repeatedly written onto an electron-sensitive layer by an electron beam. This process would normally take hours, but with multibeam Mapper devised a way to use tiny lenses to split the electrons into over 13,000 different beams, each with 49 rays. Compare it to the way an old-fashioned convex TV creates its image by using an electron beam to draw a pattern on the screen using hundreds of scanlines.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Mapper’s first concept was ready in 2007, and the company sold two prototypes: one to <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span>, and another to the French research institute <span class="fft-kk">CEA</span>-Leti in Grenoble. The start-up believed it had a good alternative to the delayed <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines, provided it could increase the output to ten or twenty wafers per hour. If ten of these machines were put next to one another, it would still be cheaper than one of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s scanners. At least, that was the idea.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The reality proved far more unmanageable, and after <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> returned their prototype, the Delft start-up changed its course. If the mass market had no need for e-beam, there still would be the low-volume market for advanced chips produced in much smaller quantities. The American defense industry was a prime target for this: for example, <span class="fft-kk">DARPA</span>, the research arm of the Pentagon, had already invested money in an e-beam program in 2003.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The latest Mapper machine promised to be a step up, but an extra injection of capital was needed to produce it. In 2012, Rusnano – a Russian state fund that invests in nanotechnology – acquired a 14 percent stake for 40 million euros. Mapper gained a Russian board member, and subsequently built a factory in Technopolis, the cluster of high-tech operations in Moscow. The factory began producing microscopic electromechanical systems for the lenses. These so-called microsystems are a type of chip produced using a regular lithography machine. To do this, Mapper ordered a machine from their rivals over in Veldhoven. The internal newsletter ran a suitably ironic headline: ‘Mapper buys <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’. Del Prado also saw the funny side – during a visit to Moscow in 2013, he sat pretentiously on a discarded <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> crate, a mischievous look on his face as his rear end straddled the Veldhoven logo.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Despite the enthusiasm of the majority shareholder, technical setbacks kept Mapper’s progress at bay. That is not to say the technology from Delft was unusable. To the contrary, the same electron beams were not only good for writing patterns, but could also be used to inspect chips for errors. This is what piqued <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s interest in Mapper – they would serve as the perfect addition to <span class="fft-kk">HMI</span>’s inspection equipment, the Taiwanese company <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had acquired in 2016. Around that time, Martin van den Brink and Jos Benschop paid repeated visits to Delft. They wanted to know if Wieland would be willing to work for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> on electron sensors, but the founder refused to bite. He was determined to make his own company a success. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> looked into whether they could acquire Mapper in its entirety, but a serious offer was never made.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In September of 2016, Arthur del Prado passed away at the age of 84. It came as a shock – he had been actively involved with Mapper until only a few months before his death, and with his passing the company also lost its most significant financial backer. Del Prado’s family funds were unable to keep the tech company afloat for much longer, as he stipulated in his will that his capital should be put towards cancer research. It was a promise he made to his wife, who passed away from the disease at a young age.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">By the beginning of 2018, Mapper was left with only six months to find another investor. No one seemed to believe Kampherbeek when he explained that the curtain was about to fall on the company – after all, more than 200 million euros had already been pumped into their machine, and it was nearing completion. Being partly owned by a Russian state fund made it difficult, particularly given the sensitivity in the West after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the downing of passenger flight MH17 by a Russian surface-to-air missile, which resulted in the loss of 298 lives.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">No stone was left unturned in the search for financiers. Kampherbeek flew around the world to speak with chip machine manufacturers in Japan, Singapore and America, but it was in vain. Briefly, Kampherbeek thought Applied Materials would bite, but the company backed out.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Mapper turned to China. Wieland traveled to Chengdu, the city known for breeding pandas, to interest investors and officials in developing a Chinese alternative to <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. For his part, Kampherbeek flew to Beijing to meet with investors. There was serious interest, but Mapper was in a hurry: bankruptcy was imminent, and they needed to strike a deal. The Chinese were unable to immediately capitalize on this surprise offer from the Netherlands. In the meantime, Mapper reluctantly sold its Moscow factory to Rusnano to be able to keep paying the salaries in Delft a little longer. The 240 employees were already running on borrowed time.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the summer of 2018, Mapper reached out to the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Department of Defense for help. They knew from earlier discussions that the Pentagon found the multibeam technology interesting; after all, it could also be used to ‘write’ unique chips for modern weapon systems or for equipment for its intelligence services. These agencies want to know for certain that their equipment cannot be hacked, and by giving each chip a unique number they could be sure who they are talking to and securely communicate without the enemy intercepting.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Pentagon thought Mapper’s technology could be used to produce advanced chips on a small scale in trusted foundries. But the presence of the Russian investor made the deal impossible. An employee from the Department of Defense tried to motivate American companies to take a stake in Mapper and get rid of the Russians. The major weapons manufacturers responded lukewarmly to the request. However, a call was also made to SecureFoundry in Fort Worth, Texas, a company founded by former marine and technical director of the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Cyber Command Lex Keen. He was still active in the field and specialized in semiconductors, spending his time acquiring patents from universities for advanced chips to be used in defense projects.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Pentagon did not give SecureFoundry a direct order – that would lead to obligations – but dropped a clear hint: Mapper was in acute financial need, and it would be great if someone stepped in to rescue the Dutch technology to benefit the American defense industry. Keen rolled up his sleeves: this task had his name written all over it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The former marine met with the team from Delft and invited Kampherbeek to Fort Worth for a few weeks to set up the deal. Kampherbeek was a guest at Keen’s financial advisor’s home. He was a local banker with Dutch roots, who gathered around the table with his deeply devoted family every morning at 6:00 a.m. for Bible study. Texan hospitality at its finest, accompanied by a large cupboard filled with rifles and pistols. ‘It’s a Hail Mary,’ Kampherbeek thought while his hosts bowed in prayer. He would go to the trenches to save his company.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Keen and Kampherbeek devised a plan together with the National Security Agency. The American intelligence agency ordered two multibeam machines from Delft, for a total of 20 million dollars. If the Pentagon paid that amount on behalf of the NSA outright, SecureFoundry would receive the distribution rights to supply the machine to<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> government agencies and Mapper could move forward with new capital. The Pentagon was on board, but first, there were Russians to be dealt with.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Keen met with the Rusnano representatives in Amsterdam. Since 2012, the Russians had expanded their stake and now represented 27.5 percent of Mapper. But they had no interest in being bought out: the Russians would only get a fraction of their investment back and would be the laughingstock of their home country. Rusnano would prefer to see Mapper go bankrupt so they could blame higher powers. However, the Russians were willing to give up their seat on the board and transfer their stake to an external trust, if Mapper continued to purchase chips from Moscow for a few more years. Keen shook hands – it sounded like a deal to him.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">SecureFoundry handled the whole episode in close coordination with the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, as Mapper still had 32 million euros worth of outstanding loans from multiple innovation creditors. Keen received a signed declaration from the economic envoy at the Dutch embassy in Washington: he had permission to invest in Mapper, and the Ministry did not require the loan to be repaid immediately. Nothing seemed to stand in the way of the company’s salvation.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In early December, Lex Keen addressed the gathered Mapper employees in Delft and told them the deal was done – there was light at the end of the tunnel. He was right about the last part, but for all the wrong reasons. When Keen flew back to the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> the next day, he received an alarming phone call from one of his colleagues during his layover in Reykjavik. The Pentagon was no longer responding. It had gone into silent mode.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Mapper had fallen victim to internal Pentagon politics and scheming between the generals and the powerful defense industry. Although 20 million dollars had been earmarked for the two machines for the NSA, the person responsible for the deal was given another job and his successor channeled the funds to an Intel project <a id="_idTextAnchor057" class="calibre3"></a>for secure chips. The influential Intel was managing a GoCo, a ‘Government-owned, Contractor-operated’ factory, where processors were being made under military supervision. At the same time, a lobbying group from the American weapons industry had knocked on the Pentagon’s door: they did not want a Dutch competitor on the scene.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Lex Keen watched his deal unravel in slow motion. By the end of 2018, the slow wheels of the Pentagon bureaucracy were dragging more than ever. The funeral of former President George Bush Senior brought Washington to a standstill for a few days, and when the Pentagon tried again to request funds for the Mapper deal, they faced another roadblock. On December 22, the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> government shut down after Democrats blocked President Trump’s plans to build a wall at the Mexican border. It lasted 35 days, making it the longest budget freeze in American history.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For Mapper, it took too long. The engineers in Delft had gone without pay for several months, and founder Wieland had calculated to the day when he would need to declare the company bankrupt in order to guarantee his employees would still be able to receive unemployment payments. On December 19, Mapper filed for suspension of payments, and on December 28 bankruptcy was declared. After eighteen years, the multibeam adventure was over.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When the Pentagon realized they had messed up the Mapper deal, panic set in. Suppose the Russians or the Chinese made off with the bankrupt estate – if the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> military had recognized the potential of the invention from Delft, surely other powers also had their eyes on it. Their concern was well-founded: Mapper had already spoken to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s Chinese competitor <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span> in the past, and Chinese investors had expressed their interest in multibeam.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Americans sounded the alarm in The Hague. In December, the Pentagon sent urgent letters to the Dutch Ministries of Defense and Economic Affairs. The message: your critical chip technology is at risk of falling into the hands of a hostile power, and you need to intervene. They personally reached out to Prime Minister Mark Rutte via the American embassy and pleaded with him to not allow this technology to vanish into China or Russia. He needed to make sure it remained in the Netherlands, even if it meant destroying it. The Pentagon figured that if Mapper went to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, the multibeam technology would hit a dead end. Anything was better than letting it fall into Chinese hands.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">That is the reason why Mona Keijzer came bursting through Veldhoven’s door on that winter’s day in 2018 and told <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, ‘You have to buy Mapper.’ There was nothing the Dutch government could do to stop the Chinese if they wanted to make their move: a law was being drafted specifically for this purpose, but it still needed approval. All hope was put on Veldhoven. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> saw no upside to multibeam lithography – the technical possibilities were limited, and <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> was already operational in chip factories – but it was interested in the patents and technical knowledge in Delft. All it needed was for the Mapper engineers to agree to abandon their old dreams of producing chips: instead, they would need to inspect them.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘We’ll definitely talk with them,’ Peter Wennink said to a radio reporter from BNR the day after Mapper filed for suspension of payment. Like a skilled politician, he managed to dodge the follow-up questions, but it had been clear for some time that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> saw the value of Mapper’s knowledge. In June 2018, Marco Wieland had even received the ‘Martin van den Brink Award’ from the man himself.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the meantime, the curator organized an auction of Mapper’s remnants to repay the main creditors, the Del Prado fund and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Sure enough, Lex Keen of SecureFoundry was there as one of the bidders. In January, the ex-marine had quickly assembled a team of Dutch investors to bid on the bankrupt estate together with former Mapper personnel. The curator had also reached out to the Chinese investment fund the engineers from Delft had previously approached. He was trying to drive up the price, but instead he was shooting the Americans in the foot. Mapper’s technology had to stay out of China, and he had just invited them to the game.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For the politicians, there was only one way the auction could end: with Mapper’s assets in Veldhoven’s hands. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> threw in a bid for 35 million euros, but Keen was still able to match that amount. When <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> dug a little deeper into their pockets and pulled out an offer of 75 million euros, the competition was flattened. Going once, going twice, and Mapper’s legacy was sold.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Although <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had to pay a high price, it was willing to work along with the plan. Mapper’s expertise was highly valuable: where else could you find one hundred experts in chip technology, and all within 130 kilometers of Veldhoven? The directors also figured it wouldn’t hurt to show some patriotism by retaining Mapper’s knowledge. It was an easy way to score some points. Because <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s relationship with the American and Dutch governments had started to sour, every bit of goodwill helped.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In January 2019, six weeks after Lex Keen had introduced himself to the Mapper employees as their knight in shining armor, a delegation from Veldhoven stood in front of a packed room in Delft. Just before they took to the improvised stage, one of the founders leaned over and whispered to the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers: ‘You won.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The 240 employees listened to the plan to preserve jobs and knowledge. Everyone could join <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> if they wanted to. Although the mechanics would have to work in Brabant, the engineers could stay in Delft to prevent the Mapper culture from immediately being stifled. Over one hundred technicians made the move and were added to the San Jose department, where <span class="fft-kk">HMI</span> was located. Mapper founder Marco Wieland did not immediately make the switch, but after six months of consideration – and a lot of therapeutic gardening – he went on to accept <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s offer. He was appointed as a fellow, in recognition of his groundbreaking technical work. Bert Jan Kampherbeek took a different path and chose to start a new company with some of his former colleagues building agricultural robots for tulip cultivation. Another fine Dutch export product.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Mapper’s intellectual property fell into <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s hands, which provided the necessary armor to fend off any patent claims – <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had already faced enough battles in this area as it was. All remaining laptops and hard drives in Delft were carefully destroyed to prevent other parties from accessing sensitive software.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Pentagon and the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> Department of Energy tried to convince <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to keep the multibeam machine alive for a trusted foundry in Massachusetts that would produce standard chips with unique codes. However, Veldhoven politely declined, and instead advised the Americans that they would be better off using different technology for this purpose. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had no interest in a Mapper 2.0 – that would only be a distraction to the talent at work in Delft.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In October 2019, the founders of Mapper and their stakeholders came together one last time. From across a round table at a fish restaurant in Delft, they reflected on eighteen years of multibeam history. They acknowledged that the deal with the Pentagon had been the final straw, even though they had been on a road to destruction for some time. There were no accusations or blame, only regret that they were unable to bring a machine to market during Del Prado’s lifetime. If they could have given him one thing, that would have been it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Mapper case highlighted how little the Netherlands was aware of the strategic value of its own chip technology. The ease with which this sensitive knowledge could have fallen into Chinese hands served as a sharp wake-up call for the country. In 2023, the ‘VIFO’ Act was put in place, which screens investments, mergers and acquisitions on potential national security issues. This law oversees vital providers and ‘businesses active in the field of sensitive technology,’ such as the semiconductor industry, and was retroactively applied from September 2020 on. In addition, in 2023 the government set aside a sum of 100 million euros to be used for immediate intervention in cases where a strategic company was at risk of falling into undesirable hands. With this, The Hague hoped to prevent another Mapper-style panic.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">There are still traces of the Mapper deal. 70 million euros are being held in the account of the Dutch auction curator, to be distributed among the creditors pending a lawsuit filed by a French trustee on an administrative issue. And if you want to take look at one of the multibeam machines up close, you only <a id="_idTextAnchor058" class="calibre3"></a>have to pay a visit to the physics building of the Delft University of Technology. Next to a coffee machine is a vacuum chamber with a window offering a view of the technical innards. This museum piece was unveiled in early 2023 by Bert Jan Kampherbeek and Professor Pieter Kruit, with whom the entire Mapper project began.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Kruit has since retired, starting a new career in 2021 leading the e-beam division of Applied Materials. This American chip equipment manufacturer is building an inspection machine that, just like <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s, works with electrons. With his talented former protégé Marco Wieland in charge of the competition, it is now time to find out if the student has become the master.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For Lex Keen, the multibeam adventure is still not over. If there is one thing the former marine knows best, it is how to persevere – no matter how many setbacks he faces. Keen purchased the Mapper machine located at <span class="fft-kk">CEA</span>-Leti in France, and had the device flown to the East Coast of the <span class="fft-kk">US </span>in 25 crates, all while the world was gripped by the <span class="fft-kk">COVID</span>-19 crisis. Since 2022, it has been standing in a cleanroom at defense company Northrop Grumman in Maryland, waiting to start producing chips. As the holders of the Mapper patents, Keen is dependent on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s cooperation for the license. He is still unsure about who his customers will be, but he knows one thing for sure: if the Pentagon comes knocking, they will have to pay up front.</p>
