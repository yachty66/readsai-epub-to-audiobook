			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Ominous shadows fill the desert plains in Arizona. Scattered amidst Native American reservations and the Phoenix mountains lay a series of fabs, built by companies like Intel, Motorola, and <span class="fft-kk">NXP</span>, with two brand-new chip factories from <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> set majestically against the horizon. Although the ‘Valley of the Sun’ enjoys about three hundred days of sun a year, the daylight never penetrates the sterile cleanrooms of these imposing structures. They remain completely sealed off from the outside world. Nothing or no one is allowed to jeopardize production.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">You only have to look up in a cleanroom to find out how well a chip factory is operating. Along the ceiling runs a stream of robots from one machine to the other, rattling back and forth with their trays full of wafers. But as soon as there’s a malfunction the stream stops, leaving the machines standing like a line of impatient motorists on the wrong side of a traffic accident.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A blockage like this is critical: the heart of the factory, the lithography machine, can no longer beat. On a normal day, the quickest devices usually spit out two or even three hundred wafers per hour, and one wafer of chips can fetch up to 250,000 dollars. To a chip manufacturer, their actual heart may as well be on the line when a scanner stands still.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Todd Garvey is one of nine thousand customer service employees working around the world to keep lithography machines ticking. Operations are run from their base in Arizona, home to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s American office since 1984. The cleanroom uniform is a dust-free bunny suit that leaves only the eyes exposed. It wouldn’t be out of place in a hospital, and neither would Garvey. He sees himself as one of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s nurses, tending to his patients throughout the day and night.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Service engineers like Garvey are responsible for keeping a fleet of forty to fifty machines in the air. It takes years to qualify for this, and this is why <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> starts training maintenance staff long before construction on a new fab begins.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">You need to have a strong bladder to work in the chip factory. Getting changed for a quick bathroom break takes so long it’s hardly worth the effort. ‘Just try not to eat or drink too much,’ advises Garvey. But good luck with that when you’re in the middle of another one of the grueling twelve-hour shifts him and his team work. They alternate hours for three consecutive days, followed by a few days off.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When his friends ask what he exactly does in the chip factory, Garvey has his answer ready: ‘I work on a highly expensive camera that photographs the same image over and over on a disc that moves at three to four hundred kilometers per hour. And it has to be razor-sharp, every time.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Garvey has felt like a father to these machines for the past 25 years. ‘They’re all my babies. When a client ordered a machine, it would be me that went to Veldhoven to see how the system was coming along. I’d watch as it grew from individual modules to a full wafer-producing machine, and watch as it was broken down again to ship out. I’d then fly with the device, my baby, the whole way to the chip factory.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Walk into any cleanroom, and you’ll find the lithography machine is always king. The most expensive tool is also responsible for the most critical part of the production process, so it’s vital that it’s kept running at full power at all times. The other machines are less of a strain on the wallet and handle the rest of the steps, such as etching, heating, and applying new layers to the wafers. In between all this, the discs are also constantly measured to check the layers of the chips are still properly aligned.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Lithography machines will work between 98 and 99 percent of the time if they receive regular maintenance. Just like on a highway, with planning you can easily minimize disruption by redirecting tasks and traffic to other production lines. It’s the crashes, the unexpected ‘tool down!’ warnings that deliver the most economic damage. And no siren will sound to tell you. They’re usually disconnected: there’s enough noise in the factory as it is.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">If a malfunction is expected to last more than 48 hours, it is better to switch the wafers to a different production line and take the reduced yield on the chin. This leaves the robots waiting patiently in line while the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> employees scramble to diagnose and revive the patient.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘It’s like needing to solve a difficult puzzle,’ says engineer Gang-san Kim. ‘When you find the solution the relief is enormous.’ You need nerves of steel to handle these delicate devices. Chip factories might be fully automated, but you can never fully escape human mistakes: loose cables, a missed bolt, falling tools, a fingerprint or scratch on a lens. But the worst thing to happen in a cleanroom is water leakage or damage to the mask. This is the unique blueprint with the chip structure, and it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to replace.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As soon as something is wrong with the masks, the top bosses in the factory swarm around the machine. ‘Too many captains, not enough crew,’ as Kim says. The managers watch on anxiously while he delves under the hood of the machine to find the problem. They dare not get involved – they know the body of wires and lenses is far too complex for them to interfere with.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It can take weeks to untangle the Gordian knot. And if <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s legion of nurses can’t work it out, the specialists in Veldhoven are summoned. Time is everything, so the longer a problem persists the higher up the chain of escalation it goes, all the way to the original designers themselves.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Wim Pas remembers his white whale clearly. The site manager for the <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> fabs north of Phoenix ran into trouble with a notorious immersion device; it would inexplicably produce faulty chips for two hours after every restart, and then run seamlessly as if nothing had happened. It took months of research to figure out why. The second the machine stopped, five droplets of water would fall on a layer of glue, causing it to expand by just a few nanometers. This was all it needed to throw off the chip-pattern. And once the moisture evaporated, the glue would shrink, leaving no trace of any error with the machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Problems like this only come to light in the harsh reality of the factory floor. Even with years of meticulous planning, half the issues these machines face could never be imagined. This is exactly why <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> leaves the fine-tuning of the design for when the engines are running. It is also the only way to find which parts wear out too quickly. As Pas says, ‘It’s only here that everything wrong with the design reveals itself.’ Then you have to hope the spare part is available – with a device comprised of so many different components, it’s almost impossible to predict and prepare in advance for what will be the first to go.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s sales department takes care of negotiations with the chip factory over which improvements fall under the warranty and which upgrades they have to pay for. The service engineers steer clear of any financial discussions. Their day-to-day work on the floors of the fabs is pressure enough. They’re on the ground, right in the line of fire: they can do without the distractions.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The lithography machine is eventually optimized using special ‘recipes’. Like a Formula 1 car getting a separate tuning for each circuit, the machines are carefully fine-tuned to the type of chips that are being produced. Chip manufacturers want each device to operate at ‘full capacity’, but as Wim Pas explains, not every machine is identical. ‘Imagine you buy two identical cars. But one can reach 150 kilometers per hour and the other 180. It’s my job to convince the chip manufacturers to be happy about having a faster car and not to moan about the one that stops at 150.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Just as Coca-Cola won’t give away its secret recipe, formulas for the chips manufacturers production are kept close to their chests. However, if you tinker too much and create problems with your machine, Veldhoven will be in touch to find out why.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Unforeseeable complications aren’t limited to the mechanics of the machines. Despite their best efforts, the cleanrooms can’t always keep the outside world at bay. Earthquakes and atmospheric pressure fluctuations due to thunderstorms can easily disrupt the lithography process. Or cows. Intel once faced an inexplicable drop in yield every night for a few hours, with researchers running in circles until they finally realized the cause: cow farts.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Every night between 1 and 2 a.m. the wind would change direction and methane gas from nearby dairy farms found its way into the cleanroom through the air purifiers. The extra gas from their sleeping neighbors was enough to affect production and dropped the percentage of flawless chips produced in this time window. Filtering the gas wasn’t possible, so Intel had to pay for three farms to relocate. Since then, everyone scouting a location for a chip factory knows to keep an eye out for cows.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">You can hardly hear modern lithography machines over the racket of the air conditioners. The old timers, such as the <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 5500, are recognizable by the metallic grunt they make as they wake up: ‘The Roar’ as the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers call it. If you hear this sound during boot-up, it means everything’s good to go. Little Easter eggs are also hidden in the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> software: those in the know can kill time on some systems with a game of Snake, the classic from the old Nokia mobile mobiles. Days can be long in the cleanrooms.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But stranger things can happen in the chip factories. About twenty years ago, a lithography system in a fab in Arizona kept experiencing malfunctions. ‘There was no technical explanation,’ according to an engineer from the factory. ‘And it wasn’t just <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s gear. All the systems had problems. The factory manager was on the verge of a breakdown, until someone pointed out that the factory was built on an old Native American burial ground. He decided that must be it: the fab was cursed.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A shaman was summoned. Right away something caught his eye: the concrete obelisks planted by the entrance of the factory resembled tombstones. He gestured; if they wanted to appease the spirits, removing those would be a good place to start. The shaman proceeded, donning a cleanroom suit and inspecting the production line. After a long silence, he turned back to the manager. ‘The spirits are attracted to red,’ he hinted, and quietly left.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It was decided. ‘If the spirits want red, that’s what we’ll give them.’ The manager’s eyes fell on a cardboard box, used as packaging for a lens from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. It was the brightest of reds. He folded it into a triangle resembling a tipi tent and placed it on the lithography machine.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As if by magic, the problems disappeared. The red box stood on the machine for years – no one was allowed near it. When the chip factory later ordered a second machine, they asked the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers, ‘Could you also put a small red tipi on that second machine?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Sure.</p>
