			<p class="_idgenobjectlayout">The engineers searched for a solution the only way they know how: through trial and error. After numerous rounds of brainstorming, building and testing, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> came up with the idea to integrate the tin droplet into the broader laser system by using it as a mirror itself. However, the laser light needed to refract back and forth several times to achieve the required strength, and by that time the miniscule droplet of tin had already vanished. Martin van den Brink realized he hadn’t considered the ultimate limit: the speed of light. ‘It took five years for<span class="fft-kk"> </span>us to realize: you couldn’t trust the droplet.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was back to square one. The German manufacturer Trumpf, supplier of the laser, had to tackle the problem together with specialists from Veldhoven and San Diego. By this point, the laser apparatus for the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine already consisted of more than 450,000 parts. Figuring it could handle a few more, the engineers devised a way to divert and cut off the reflected light before it could return to its origin. It took until 2008 for the trick to work, but by then the celebration was dampened: a new set of obstacles had already crashed the party. Starting the light source ‘cleanly’ turned out to be a challenge – just like a cold diesel engine emits a thick plume of soot first thing in the morning. The tin droplet also left a residue on the mirror after every explosion. This mirror is the ‘collector’ that gathers the light together, so as this layer thickens, the power decreases. This meant it needed to be constantly removed and cleaned, leaving the chip machine standing idle for long periods. It would be years before <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would get this problem under control.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">This whole process also required an extremely large amount of energy to retain enough light to actually print the chip patterns – far more than regular scanners. During its journey through the lithography machine, the light beam comes across 10 mirrors, each absorbing 30 percent of the light. Martin van den Brink quickly did the math: ‘It starts with 1.5 megawatts from the grid, that yields 30 kilowatts in the laser, and that creates 100 watts of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light. Of this, about 1 watt ends up on the wafer.’ The only thing these machines seemed good at was running at a loss, but at some point, they needed to turn a profit. So step by step, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> upped the power. When it comes to illuminating on such a fine scale, only the most brutish lasers will do.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But more power also creates more heat. This causes the mirrors to expand, which in turn causes small deviations that immediately need to be corrected with small motors. Even the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> mask, which carries the blueprint of the chip on it, is itself an extremely sensitive mirror. And like a 5-star–resort guest demanding nothing but perfection, even the slightest speck of dust on that mirror is unacceptable. But how do you keep all this clean? The machine might operate in a vacuum, but molecules can still penetrate the sealed chambers and settle on the mirrors. This led <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to impose extra high demands on the cleanrooms the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines need to be built in. Only ten dust particles of 100 to 200 nanometers in size can be tolerated in one cubic meter of cleanroom air – more than a thousand times cleaner than the air in a hospital operating room.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Hans Meiling already calculated back in 1998 what <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> would cost the chip manufacturers. According to his numbers, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was vastly underestimating the financial consequences of the new technology. In retrospect, he figures this was for the best. No respectable <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> would sign for a project that would take twenty years, without any promise of success or interim profit to carry it through. That’s not taking a bet, that’s bananas. This is also why the Japanese competition dropped out of the race: not because their engineers were any less capable, but because Nikon and Canon were simply not prepared to continue pumping so much money into <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The real race against the clock began in 2006. Immediately after his <span class="fft-kk">SPIE</span> presentation, Martin van den Brink sold the first <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machine to Samsung from his room in the Amsterdam hotel The Grand, agreeing to deliver it by 2010. This was a daring deadline for commercial introduction: Samsung had demanded starting off with a machine that delivered 100 watts of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was not even hitting 5.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">From that moment on, Van den Brink required daily updates on the light source. Even during vacations – nothing was more important. One summer, frustrated by the lack of signal, he left his apartment in Italy in search of a suitable mountaintop to make the call from. Over the following two hours, it became clear just how much the issues at Cymer in San Diego had started to pile up. Every solution was causing new, bizarre problems. His heart sank. Van den Brink knew more money was needed to bring an end to the monstrous project. But where do you source capital when the financial world is collapsing, and dragging the chip industry along with it?</p>
