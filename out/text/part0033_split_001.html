			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Please, do be careful when you shake hands with Joann. She has the most remarkable fine motor skills, honed through years of work in <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s cleanroom in San Diego. Hunched over a machine in complete concentration, she carefully wraps two wires around what is known as “the nozzle”. That is what they call the spout at the heart of the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light source, responsible for shooting tin droplets through a hollow needle at a rate of fifty thousand times per second.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Only Joann and one of her colleagues have the ability to wind and solder these virtually invisible wires. It’s a delicate task few could ever master. ‘Even watchmakers can’t do this,’ says their awestruck boss, ‘and there’s no way to automate it.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is not a trivial matter: the nozzle regularly gets clogged during day-to-day use in the chip factory. When that inevitably happens, the only thing to do is to swap it out for a new one. It’s hard to imagine, but without the fingers of Joann and her colleague, the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines at Samsung and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> would grind to a halt. In the year 2023, two pair of human hands keep the world’s most advanced chip production lines in motion.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> laboratory in San Diego is expanding that same year, as is every <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> facility. Lithography machines are in high demand, and extra space is needed to test the prototype light-source for the new generation of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines. If you want more power, you need to shoot a higher frequency of droplets, and it is up to the engineers here to figure out how. For all the mind-bending physics that take place in a lithography machine, this part is exactly as it sounds. And for once, you can even see it: in their test set-up, you can watch the rapid fire of molten droplets, like tiny dots silently floating in a metal tube.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The door to another cleanroom swings open to reveal ‘The Monster’, as it is affectionately known among the staff. This metal behemoth, standing several meters tall, surrounds the vacuum chamber where the plasma goes to ignite. The whole light source exudes an otherworldly aura – like an engine block hoisted straight out of a spaceship. Nearby, an engineer closely inspects a wafer full of tin splatters in her hand. With these discs, they can check whether the heart of The Monster is still beating reliably. Somewhere deep in the steel bowels of the beast lies the nozzle that Joann soldered, and in the chamber next to it sits the laser, ready to begin blasting away.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Elsewhere in a sealed control room, three engineers examine the latest results. They can finally cheer: the lab has successfully generated 600 watts of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light. But there’s no chance to take the foot off the gas. Everyone’s already talking about the next milestone: 1000 watts.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Ten years earlier, Martin van den Brink didn’t even dare to dream of such numbers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2013, the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> source’s power output was far too low to support profitable chip production. The droplet generator needed to have perfect timing and deliver a perfect droplet every time for it be useful. But the components were small and fragile. They constantly leaked, got clogged or simply broke off under the high pressure. Most of the droplet generator was still hand-made by Cymer and it was virtually impossible to test the part in advance. This made for completely unpredictable yields: in the initial phase of production, half of the droplet generators didn’t even work. It would take years to industrialize this work and get it ready for mass production.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">As soon as the acquisition was made, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> cleaved Cymer in two. It was a strict division of assets, designed to prevent any conflict of interest. The result of the split is clearly visible on Thormint Court, a dead-end road to the north of San Diego where the company is located. Look to one side and you’ll see the ‘old’ Cymer, ticking along with the production of regular lasers just as before. They even still supply to competing chip machine manufacturers like Canon and Nikon. Not that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> minds – more important is what is on the other side of the street. There you’ll find the closely guarded <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> facility: this is where the real action is, and access is strictly <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>-only.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With the takeover complete, Martin van den Brink immediately hauled a significant part of the light-source development over to Veldhoven. In the space of a few months, there were already over 1000 engineers working away at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and laser manufacturer Trumpf – four times the size of the team in San Diego. There was no time to waste in trying to convince the American Cymer employees to ‘the new way of thinking,’ as Van den Brink called it. When it comes to industrializing complex technology, you need the ruthless Dutch touch.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The very first <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> experiments at Cymer were conducted by Australian engineer Danny Brown. Before landing on tin droplets, all kinds of metals were subjected to the lasers in his lab in an effort to generate the special light. ‘Thankfully, somehow, nothing exploded. But nothing worked either.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Once <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> took the reins, Brown found himself under enormous pressure to increase and stabilize the power output. Every year <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was publishing a list of the largest technical obstacles, and every year, Cymer was number one. San Diego quickly had to get accustomed to Dutch engineering style: they would drill straight into any weak spot, like a dentist dealing with a rotting tooth. And there was no time wasted on anesthesia. It was direct, blunt, and in the eyes of the Americans, often downright rude. As a result, the new partners became increasingly reluctant to report setbacks. Unfortunately for them, hiding a problem out of fear was the quickest way to hit a nerve in Veldhoven. When Frits van Hout took over the project in 2013, he felt this all too well: ‘Cymer were forever promising it’ll get better. It was always “it will be done next week” and then, of course, it wouldn’t happen. It drove<span class="fft-kk"> </span>us crazy – they wouldn’t ever just give it to<span class="fft-kk"> </span>us straight.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van Hout arranged retreats to a hotel in Kasterlee in Belgium in an effort to bring the project leaders and departments closer together. With Veldhoven fifty kilometers away and all the pressure and obstacles out of sight, they could calmly evaluate the state of affairs over a series of lunches and dinners. Every month they were also joined by an engineer from San Diego, and two times a year a similar session would take place in San Diego. They needed this to work, and it could only be done together.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Getting <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> technology up and running was already complex enough, but <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> made it even more challenging by kickstarting the next generation of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines. These systems had a larger lens aperture, known in technical terms as ‘High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span>’ systems. This was understandably frustrating for the teams from Cymer, and the retreats became battlegrounds where managers bickered over available budgets. With the lens manufacturer Zeiss’ lengthy preparation time, these machines were still about ten years away from hitting the market.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">According to Van Hout’s calculations, the development of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> was costing <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> 10 million euros per week, and it had yet to pay them a single cent. Meanwhile, the outside world was reacting with skepticism to every delay publicly announced by the company. Competitors were quietly hopeful: it looked like the fire that had carried <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> so far was set to burn out.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Pressure mounted on the project leaders: every arduous step carried the weight of the company’s future. Now more than ever they needed to pull together, so the senior management decided to go on an outing with someone skilled in herding lost souls: a local Brabant shepherd. The <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers were tasked with guiding the sheep into the pen themselves, with the occasional helpful nudge from the yelping sheepdogs. One sheep in, three sheep out: after having worked on <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> for so long, the process felt all too familiar.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> designers were given a somewhat less biblical outing – stress prevention courses. The management knew the greatest risk was people working too hard and burning out before the machine could get up and running. Van Hout tried to convince the technicians of this when he told them they shouldn’t go at it ‘like idiots’. </p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The course leader was met with a group of enthusiastic, bright people all around the age of thirty. A handful were clearly on the verge of burnout, and the rest were busy wrestling with their own perfectionism: the worst thing you can ask an <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’er is to choose between delivering on time or delivering quality.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">They began with a little food for thought: ‘Stress itself is not something that happens to us, but how we respond to something that happens to us.’ An image flashed up on the screen. It’s an overburdened donkey, struggling with a heavily laden cart but refusing to give up. They all know that feeling.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One of the stress prevention tips seemed tailor made for the participants. ‘When a supervisor says, “I want to speak to you in ten minutes,” your heartrate skyrockets. We all know why – you’ve immediately assumed they’re angry.’ The tip: think of nice things instead. ‘Trick your brain by imagining a laughing baby, or a tropical paradise. Push that image of a barking boss out of your mind – think of a puppy wagging its tail with joy!’</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">When it came to the light source, every step forward felt as if it was followed by two steps back. One of the worst setbacks was in the expensive optical system. The lithography machine regularly needed to be stopped to replace the mirrors, as they were extremely vulnerable to contamination from carbon deposits. These would settle on the surface, dirtying them and eating away at the power. The machines had to pump continuously to remove unwanted matter from the vacuum chambers: one stray fingerprint was enough to require an extra 24 hours of pumping. Only when a chemical analysis confirmed everything was back below the contamination threshold could the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light be flicked back on.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In addition, it turned out the mirrors developed blisters. The coating consisted of dozens of wafer-thin layers, which were actually a stack of mini-mirrors to deflect unwanted light frequencies. Much like your own skin during a long day at the beach, these layers would burn easily, and the consequent blisters caused the light to rapidly lose power. The result: fewer wafers per hour, and more angry clients. Graciousness is not the name of the game when there’s this much money on the line, and customers were not happy with Veldhoven.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Samsung and <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> were already using prototype machines in 2013, running trials to iron out any problems before embarking on full-scale production with <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. As part of this, the chipmakers expected all problems <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> found to be reported immediately, but Veldhoven had its own strategy for these bad-news conversations. The engineers wanted to first identify a ‘course of solution’ for any acute problems before alerting the impatient chip manufacturers. In the experience of Hans Meilling, ‘if you immediately tell your customer about a stumbling block but you have no idea how you’re even going to try and solve it, that’s the easiest way to make a bad impression.’ And as he sees it, this isn’t a matter of being dishonest: ‘Obviously you should not talk complete nonsense, but you don’t always have to disclose everything you know. That is different from not telling the truth.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The delay in <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> development dragged on for years. The struggle with the light source was stressful for everyone. Even Van den Brink acknowledges this. There were moments when he also wondered if they would ever get on top of it. ‘But it’s just like your time in the military – when you’re in the thick of it, it’s terrible. But in retrospect, it’s the best time of your life.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Not that he was ever in military service – he was exempt. Probably for the best: good luck getting Martin to follow an order.</p>
