			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The chip industry grows through shrinking. The more circuits crammed per square millimeter, the more valuable the disc of chips that rolls out of the factory. With every step down in scale, a chip of the same size becomes more powerful, more efficient, and better value for money. That opens the door to new uses and applications for the chips, which in turn means more profit for manufacturers.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But Moore’s Law keeps knocking. Well before the turn of the millennium, the semiconductor industry realized it needed a new light source for lithography machines if it wanted to keep doubling the number of transistors every two years. No one imagined it would take two decades for this quest to yield results. ‘The source was always a problem,’ noted Martin van den Brink in 2023. ‘In fact, it is <span class="fft-cursief">still</span> a problem.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The second half of the ’90s was a race to reach this milestone. With deep ultraviolet light cranked to its limit, Canon, Nikon, the American <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span>, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> all started researching which technique would have the most potential when it came to printing even smaller structures. Three options came to light: printing with ions, writing patterns with electron beams (e-beam) or ‘printing’ with extreme ultraviolet light (<span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>). <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> figured that <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> lithography, with its wavelength of between 10 and 100 nanometers, would be the most profitable. Manufacturers don’t want a hundred machines that produce one wafer per hour. They want one machine that can spit out hundreds. All <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needed to do was figure out how to make that happen.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Sun’s corona, 93 million miles away, is the closest place you can find extreme ultraviolet light in its natural form. On Earth, however, generating EUV requires extremely sophisticated technology. One way is to shoot a powerful laser beam at a tiny droplet of hot tin. This creates a plasma, an energy charged form of gas, far hotter than the surface of the sun. In this process, invisible light with a wavelength of 13.5 nanometers is emitted. If you can catch this with a mirror, you can direct it into a lithography machine to project a chip pattern. Sounds simple: you just have to build a sun. </p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The preparatory research into utilizing <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> for chip production took place across three continents. Initial experiments were run in the 1980s by scientists at <span class="fft-kk">NTT</span> in Japan, with the United States and the Netherlands following suit soon after. Finally, in 1990 Professor Fred Bijkerk from Twente succeeded in creating an image using <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light. A good start, but still a ways away from being able to print an entire working chip with it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 1997, Intel assembled a consortium of tech companies and initiated the ‘<span class="fft-kk">EUV-LLC</span>’ research program. It included Motorola, amd, the Department of Energy, American national laboratories: all titans responsible for the birth of the industry itself. When the Cold War began to heat up, these labs tried to keep the Russian threat at bay by staying one pace ahead in the technological race. The scientists at these institutes were working on new semiconductor tools  and nuclear devices. Both were important weapons in the eyes of the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union, America’s hunger for the technology started to dwindle. The Iron Curtain had fallen, taking with it any sense of urgency for the Americans, and government budgets for research into semiconductor technology were gradually scaled back. If Silicon Valley wanted to follow through with this technology, it was going to have to drag itself over the line. In these years, Intel stepped up and became the most important backer of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>-<span class="fft-kk">LLC</span>. In April 2001, a prototype device capable of creating lines only 10 nanometers across finally appeared in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. However, it cost 250 million dollars to build, and the consortium expected it would take another 250 to 750 million before it would be ready for mass production. Plus, it would take time: the general consensus suggested it would be 2005 before an <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>-produced chip would roll off a factory production line. That estimate turned out to be off by fifteen years.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was already keeping an eye on the ball in the earliest years of <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> technology. In November 1995, Steef Wittekoek, together with Fred Bijkerk and Richard Freeman of Bell Labs, took a <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>-workshop at Zeiss. ‘Lots to be done,’ was the verdict scrawled in his notebook. It would have to wait.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 1997, Jos Benschop, the head of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s research group, revisited whether <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> was a feasible option. After a series of initial tests, it turned out that Zeiss was able to develop the extremely smooth mirrors needed to guide the <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light. The balance was shifting: enough pieces of the puzzle had fallen into place for this impossible machine to become a reality. And so, with financial support from European and German governments, in 1998 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> partnered with Zeiss and started the Euclides consortium for <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. Before long, Philips, <span class="fft-kk">TNO</span> and the German Fraunhofer Institute were also on board, and in 1999 the European and American <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> initiatives decided to join forces. This was perfect for Intel: it was already pushing for more lithography manufacturers to join <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>-<span class="fft-kk">LLC</span> so it would have a choice of different suppliers when the technology was ready. The American <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> already had a license, but when Nikon and Canon came knocking, Congress put their foot down. There was no way they were going to allow the Japanese companies to profit from American tax dollars. </p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As long-standing allies of the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>, the Dutch had no trouble securing approval. But to actually get the license, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> still needed permission from the committee investigating foreign investments in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>. And so, in 1999, Martin van den Brink began talks with Ernest Moniz, who was then undersecretary of Energy.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With his wavy silver-gray pageboy haircut, physics professor Moniz is instantly recognizable. He granted Van den Brink the license, on the condition that <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> builds a factory in the<span class="fft-kk"> US</span> to deliver the American <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines and prioritize the use of American suppliers – something he proudly recounted to the <span class="fft-kk">EE</span><span class="fft-cursief"> Times</span> in February 1999. But the Dutch company would never meet these conditions, nor did it ever intend to. Van den Brink wasn’t too sure about <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> at that time, he recalls. ‘My story to Moniz was quite simple. <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> meant a huge risk for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and that is why we would only accept this deal on our terms.’  </p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Negotiations were dragging on in the dark library of the Department of Energy. ‘Stop saying “no” and just give them what they want,’ his lawyer advised. ‘We can edit this deal later.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van den Brink treated the Americans to a fancy dinner after work, seeking a change of atmosphere with a nice view of the White House. But he had to leave before the final agreement was signed. ‘Tomorrow morning, I expect to see the contract with the right conditions on my desk in Veldhoven,’ Martin ordered, and caught the last British Airways flight out of Washington. While Moniz was proud of ‘keeping high-paying jobs in the <span class="fft-kk">US</span>’, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was already putting its own plan into motion: the previously mentioned purchase of the American competitor <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span>, complete with its <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> license, for 1.6 billion dollars. Once the Dutch plan to annex <span class="fft-kk">SVG</span> was approved, the game was over. Only one Western lithography manufacturer was now in charge of developing <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> machines. Japan was still trying with its own research program, but without the American patents, Canon and Nikon never stood a chance.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This was how, under the careful eye of the cfius<span class="fft-kk"> </span>watchdog, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> gathered a virtual monopoly over <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span>. But the technology was still very much in its infancy, and in the race to keep up with Moore’s Law, there was no guarantee <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had its money on the winning horse. <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> light was, and still is, extremely difficult to generate and sustain in an industrial environment. The invisible rays are absorbed by almost all materials, even the air, which means the lithography machine needs to have mirrors in place of lenses and can only operate in a vacuum.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin was keenly aware of this when he encountered Rob van Aken, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s in-house architect, in 2001. ‘Hey Rob, can you make an entire factory in a vacuum?’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Van Aken was startled: ‘Not really. Don’t people need to work there? Can’t see that happening without oxygen.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘Yeah, damn,’ replied van den Brink, his brow furrowed. ‘Guess we’ll have to figure this one out ourselves.’</p>
