			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Frits Philips would be proud. The band that is playing in the hall named after the famous industrialist at the Muziekgebouw in Eindhoven is knocking it out of the park. Sounds from other rooms float in, blending with their brand of Indonesian pop: a little Indian dance here, some South African rock there, a hint of Brazilian carnival music to finish things off. The artists have one thing in common: they all work at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, the high-tech company that has transformed the region around Eindhoven into a global city. A place where you encounter smart people from all corners of the world. This is ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> On Stage,’ an annual music event where everyone, whether family, friend, or neighbor, is welcome.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It is March of 2023, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has completely occupied center stage. Not that it has a choice – the company is too big to hide behind the other large Brabant enterprises. For a long time, the chip machine maker from Veldhoven was counted among the ‘big five’, the group of the most important manufacturing companies in the region, such as <span class="fft-kk">DAF</span> Trucks, Philips, chip manufacturer <span class="fft-kk">NXP</span> and <span class="fft-kk">VDL</span>. But when the demand for lithography systems exploded in 2020, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was propelled head and shoulders above the rest. It is the fastest grower, the largest employer and the biggest investor in research and development, investing 4 billion euros in 2023. The southeast of Brabant has become home to the brain of the Dutch high-tech industry, which is why it is called the Brainport region.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is located on a slice of land tucked between the A67 highway and a long road called the Kempenbaan. If you want to see how rapidly the company is growing, you can either take the Veldhoven-Zuid exit from the N2 highway, or jump on a bus from Eindhoven Central Station to the De Run industrial park.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The original headquarters from the 1980s, characterized by its distinctive white ‘hat’, was finally demolished in 2022. In no time at all, new office complexes designed to accommodate ten thousand employees were erected in its place. One piece of the old façade was preserved, just as a reminder of the early days. Another reminder came in the form of a visit by Frits Philips on a Friday in 1986. It was December 12, and Mr. Philips, well in his eighties, had insisted on driving over to the headquarters himself. However, he accidentally ended up at a different white building, owned by the manufacturer of office furniture Ahrend. Of course, they did not turn down the opportunity to give the esteemed industrialist a tour. As time went on, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> management grew increasingly concerned. Following a few calls via the landline, they managed to track down the missing guest. He finally appeared in the correct white building later that day and was greatly impressed by what he saw. As he departed, he whispered some words of wisdom: ‘Gentlemen, persevere.’ And they did.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">These days, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s headquarters is impossible to miss. The complex in the De Run industrial park is expanding, with the chip machine manufacturer absorbing all of the surrounding land, roads, businesses and houses as it grows. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has even bought an entire street, complete with thirteen houses and a nearby sports complex, to demolish <a id="_idTextAnchor070" class="calibre3"></a>at a later time. It is as if they are playing a game of Monopoly. But for the most part, the tech giant is tangled up in a game of Twister. It is bending over backwards to get its hands on any free spot of <a id="_idTextAnchor071" class="calibre3"></a>land, and is trying not to collapse in a heap in the process. They don’t always manage. For example, in 2023 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is forced to demolish part of its own offices and research department. It is a waste of capital, but the factory urgently needs space to expand its cleanrooms. There’s no time to hesitate – it just needs to go.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Nearby residents are constantly confused as their large neighbor continually shifts its boundaries and erects new buildings. In 2023, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> spent over a billion euros on new construction projects across all of its locations.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When it comes to changing zoning plans, the municipality of Veldhoven consistently emphasizes the ‘global, national and regional’ economic significance of the chip machine manufacturer. In other words: it needs to be allowed to grow, even if that means vertically. The standard <span class="fft-kk">EUV</span> systems are three to four meters high, while the new High <span class="fft-kk">NA</span> systems reach up to five or six meters. Once you add in the additional meters required for hoisting components plus the entire floor needed for processing the air in the cleanroom, you end up with a factory twenty to thirty meters high. And no amount of green belts and sound barriers will stop a building like this from dominating its surroundings.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With an increasingly complex machine on its hands, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> wants to keep the web of engineers closely knit. Instead of working remotely, the development department prefers to have the thousands of technicians physically together. It makes it easier to discuss interfaces, the connecting elements between the modules of the machine, and it helps to improve collaboration with the factory. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s employees are better able to ‘read’ one another when they sit face-to-face, just as Martin preached in his philosophy on feedback. This leads to less miscommunications, but also to more commuters.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It’s a tough time to be a daily traveler in southeast Brabant. Most people go to work by car, which leads to everyday blockages on the access route across the Kempenbaan and the surrounding highways. And no matter how many parking garages <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> builds, it never seems to be enough.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2019, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> contributed 12.5 million euros to help improve local roads, provide new shuttle buses and to implement biking alternatives. It even participated in a government-led experiment called Mobility as a Service, or MaaS, hoping this would encourage employees to get out of their cars. When congestion levels around Veldhoven return to their pre-pandemic levels, the government realizes that their magic cure has failed. The MaaS project is deemed ‘too complicated’, and the plug is pulled in 2023. As an alternative, the company offers employees free public <a id="_idTextAnchor072" class="calibre3"></a>transportation and it builds additional lockers to park their bikes. Now, about 40 percent of the Veldhoven employees commute by bike, which is more than the national average.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Attempts to make the campus more accessible also often run into democratic barriers. Residents in Eindhoven protest plans for a four-meter-wide high-speed bike lane between De Run and the High Tech campus. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s plans for mega-parking lots in the surrounding area receive similar treatment. No one wants a box with 2500 cars lumped in their backyard.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In reality, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> rarely hears ‘no’ to its expansion plans. Occasionally a drawing might need to be adjusted, or some protesting residents need financial compensation, as happened when the 22-story headquarters was built without a permit. ‘This is not Singapore,’ said one project manager from the province. Even a global player must adhere to the rules in Veldhoven. Trying to fit all of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s expansion plans into this town is becoming increasingly complex, just like Moore’s Law.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For years, the Brainport region has been scraping together money from all kinds of sources to improve the area’s infrastructure. However, a bigger budget is needed to accommodate <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s expected doubling in size. The metropolitan area of Eindhoven, made up of nine municipalities, will need to find around 62,000 extra homes and 72,000 jobs by 2040. For the 21 municipalities that make up the entire Brainport region, 100,000 additional homes will be needed. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is not entirely to blame for the scale of this increase, but they are certainly the main driver. By Brainport’s estimates, every extra job at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> creates one and a half additional jobs in the region. And even that is conservative, according to Veldhoven. The high-tech sector also generates work in construction, healthcare and education. Take this into account, and the number jumps to two or three jobs.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Brainport foundation is the nerve center of the region, where local governments, businesses and educational institutions from the area all come together to collaborate. They form a united front that allows these groups to pressure the government for extra financial support. But no matter how much the mayors and companies hammer on the door in The Hague, the high-tech manufacturing industry in the south receives little structural help. This touches a historical nerve. Brabant lies outside of what is called the ‘Randstad’ – a collection of all the major cities and towns in the Netherlands that house half the population. Typically, the locus of power, cultural capital and state funding has been focused in these areas – to the detriment of those in the south. But as the Brainport Foundation points out, more investment in research is being made in Brabant than in the Randstad. In addition, due to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and its network of suppliers, the added value per resident in the surroundings of Eindhoven is higher than in Rotterdam or Amsterdam.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In The Hague, Brainport’s pleas usually go in one ear and out the other. In the eyes of most policy makers, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> makes incomprehensible equipment for an equally incomprehensible market – something to do with chips or computers, but they are not exactly sure. In 2018, the Rutte cabinet was more concerned with retaining large multinational companies in the Netherlands by scrapping the dividend tax. Their multibillion-dollar plan ended up a failure. Unilever left the country in 2020, and Shell relocated its headquarters to the United Kingdom in 2021, detaching itself and becoming entirely British in a sort of reverse Brexit. The Limburg-based food company <span class="fft-kk">DSM</span> followed suit, making it the third multinational to jump ship. Philips remains in the Netherlands, but the company is a shell of its former self, and its market cap is dwarfed by <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It takes a catastrophic chip shortage and a dramatic escalation of geopolitical tensions for the penny to drop in The Hague. In addition to being the largest Dutch multinational, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is a major job creator, and it needs assistance to be able to progress and keep its surrounding area moving forward. But the responsible ministries are slow to jump into action. Along with other executives from the Brainport foundation, financial director Roger Dassen has been nagging the government for years to provide financial support. Coincidentally, Dassen is in the area when the decisive phone call comes through, albeit a few thousand feet in the air.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">In June of 2022, ministers Micky Andriaansens and Schreinemacher are on a Dutch government plane on its way to a conference in Berlin. Roger Dassen is also present, as part of a delegation of tech companies sitting in the back of the aircraft. While in German airspace, Adriaansens calls Minister of Infrastructure and Water Management, Mark Harbers, to see if he wants to consider allocating money for the Brainport region. He agrees, and by the end of 2022, the Dutch government has reserved 1.6 billion euros for the improvement of Brainport’s infrastructure and housing via a multiyear infrastructure and transport program. A third of the cost falls to local and provincial governments, and with the help of the business community, a high-quality public transport line will be created from Eindhoven Central Station to De Run. However, this is still not enough. New transport hubs need to be created around Veldhoven to ease congestion. And houses. Tremendous numbers of houses. By all projections, Eindhoven is set to grow from 230,000 to 300,000 residents in the next twenty years. Of course, many <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers want to live in the city. But construction is slow, and new employees are forced to find housing in nearby towns and villages, which only causes further congestion.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">New workers from abroad have an advantage in the housing market. They get a tax break during their first five years in the Netherlands, and pay no income tax on 30 percent of their salary. This gives them more flexibility when bidding on a house, but prices out people who are on a regular income. When Dutch politicians suggest axing the tax break, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and other technology companies are rubbed the wrong way. They argue it is crucial for attracting and retaining international talent, and thereby growing the Dutch economy. On the other hand, the severe housing crisis in the Netherlands is forcing many young adults with average incomes to live with their parents, with no end in sight.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In Brabant, they regularly reminisce about Philips’ handling of the housing shortage. In the 1930s, the electronics company built Drents Dorp, an entire neighborhood complete with thousands of houses for migrant workers from the north of the country. In those days, the women and children went to work in the factories – their small hands were perfect for assembling devices – while the men were left to grow vegetables at home. As a result, many of the houses in Drents Dorp have remarkably long yards.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has no intention of building its own village. But the company does invest millions of euros in a housing fund under the Brainport banner. The goal is to keep mid-range housing affordable for everyone, even people working outside of the technology sector. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> does not want to be another Philips, but neither does Eindhoven want to become another San Francisco, where only a select few can afford housing and homelessness dominates the streets.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The foreign employees settling in Veldhoven and Eindhoven continue to enrich the region and add a whole new layer of character. The internationals seek each other out to play sports after work. Every weekend, Indian and Pakistani athletes take to the field to play cricket at the local soccer club, VV Gestel. Around two to three thousand people from India are now living and working around Eindhoven, with one street that is now known locally as ‘Curry Lane’ due to the thirteen South Indian families that live there. This is a slightly friendlier name than ‘Wokhoven’, the nickname for the international community that settled in Meerhoven, a new neighborhood between Eindhoven airport and Veldhoven. Subtlety has never been a strong point of the Dutch.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Yet the Brainport region needs even more technical brains. Available talent is in short supply, and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> snaps up a large portion of the workforce. Even when the chip industry started slowing down in 2023, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> continued to grow at a rate of 400 new employees per month.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The cramped labor market creates friction between <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> and other entrepreneurs in Brabant. Salaries are about 20 percent higher at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> than at other Brainport companies, and it is nearly impossible to compete with Veldhoven’s generous profit-sharing and bonus policy. This comes with its own risks: if companies in the supply chain are unable to bring in new workers, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> will become stuck itself. At the same time, there’s nothing it can do to stop employees from other companies wanting to apply for positions at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The chip machine maker prefers to fish outside this pool for new employees, turning instead to sources such as foreign universities. But like all manufacturing companies, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> also needs skilled technicians to handle the assembly of chip machines. Craftsmen like these are scarce, which is why <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> makes a drive to attract car mechanics. But the campaign misses the mark, and the derogatory slogan, ‘Swap the dirty garage for the cleanroom’ is understandably unpopular in Brabant. It sits uneasily with Veldhoven’s carefully curated image: they are supposed to be the friendly neighbor, with wholesome visiting days for the locals and a little memorial stone for ‘Grandma Betsie’, whose house had to be demolished to make way for the logistics center 5L.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> feels at home in Veldhoven. You often see the ever-approachable Peter Wennink shopping for his groceries in the local supermarket or waiting for his coupons – after all, he is a resident of the town himself. But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has not been ‘just another neighbor’ for a long time. It is the most valuable tech company in Europe, which means it is measured by standards that go far beyond the confines of this small village. It comes as no surprise then when the chip machine manufacturer tries to break free from the Metalektro collective labor agreement, much to the disdain of the unions. According to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, the collective financial arrangements for staff are no longer fitting of a high-tech multinational. And multinational it is – you can feel and see it when walking around the campus. With forty percent of their employees coming in from abroad, Veldhoven is becoming a global village.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">For years, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s management was in survival mode. The only question on their mind was how they would survive the next week, or even day. But now that it has grown to such heights, the outside world is beginning to see the company in a different light. In turn, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needs to emerge from its bubble and have a more mature view on the world. <a id="_idTextAnchor073" class="calibre3"></a>With this in mind, the supervisory board urges the company to present itself differently in its annual reports. Don’t just throw out some dry numbers, they say, but provide a compelling story – something for people to get behind. Traditionally, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s reports were just lists of numbers stapled together. Direct and to the point, in true <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> fashion. ‘Just print it on toilet paper,’ as former <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> Eric Meurice liked to joke.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> takes no half measures. The yearly report is now a massive publication, that recounts every detail of its commitments over the past year. The 2023 edition consists of more than three hundred pages, half of them dedicated to sustainability, diversity and the company’s social responsibilities. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> does not want to just make better chips – it wants to improve the entire world. It is a promise meant to inspire a new generation of high-tech talent, one that appreciates an employer who considers more than just the bottom line.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2023, the chip machine manufacturer starts a Society and Community Engagement initiative. The goal is to invest at least 100 million euros per year from 2025 in community projects that also serve <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s interests, with the stimulation of technical education as a key focal point. For example, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has founded the Junior Academy to familiarize the sixty thousand elementary school students in southeast Brabant with technology. More hands and brains are urgently needed in the Brainport region to save the manufacturing industry, especially <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, from falling into trouble. There are thousands of open positions in the tech sector, compounded by the growth of the sector and the aging Dutch workforce. But it will take more than a boost in primary education to fill the more than seventy thousand vacancies.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Higher education institutions such as TU Eindhoven, Fontys in Tilburg, and the Summa College lack the capacity to train the number of tech students that are required. The technical university wants to grow from 13,000 to 21,000 students by 2032, but finds itself turning away interested talent due to a lack of available housing. In addition, vocational education programs are seeing fewer young people who opt for technical studies, despite the high demand from companies.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">And so, the limits of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s growth in Brabant are creeping into view. The company is projected to have eighty thousand employees by 2030, half of whom will be working in Veldhoven. The balance between the prosperity <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> brings and the well-being of everything around it is approaching a tipping point. A gigantic enterprise is growing, absorbing the technical talent in the region and dominating the supply chains. At the same time, it is the largest creator of jobs for the Dutch knowledge economy. That’s not something you say no to.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Eindhoven region knows the risks of placing all their bets on one large company. In the ’90s, Philips’ traumatic cuts decimated the city and the spirit of the workforce that populated it. The dismantling of Philips is still ongoing: in the summer of 2023, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> suddenly hired one hundred Eindhoven-based experts from Philips that were in danger of being laid off.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Brainport wants to stay diverse, with enough room and talent for tech companies other than <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to thrive. The foundation’s goal is to have different companies in and around Eindhoven focusing on emerging key technologies, related to the medical field, energy transition, quantum chips or photonics, which are semiconductors capable of producing and guiding laser light. Once it becomes possible to scale up the industrial production of these new technologies, it can move into surrounding regions such as Flanders in Belgium or northern Limburg. It is a modern take on the old Philips approach, in which factories were built all over the country, but the NatLab, the heart of the innovation, was kept central.</p>
			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Since Veldhoven is bursting at the seams, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> now makes use of satellite offices, such as the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven, a ‘home office’ in Den Bosch and the old Mapper division in Delft. Part of the research lab has also moved to a location shared with the Eindhoven Technical University – one of the last free dots of land in this giant game of Twister. The investment costs hundreds of millions of euros, but <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needs the space to breathe.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">However, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is not only growing in Brabant. The foreign branches also need to keep up: the company made extra investments in the Korean province of Gyeonggi and in New Taipei City in Taiwan in 2022, with each expansion costing hundreds of millions of dollars and requiring thousands of new employees. The Wilton division in Connecticut also expanded considerably, transforming the town of 18,503 residents (according to the 2020 census) into a vibrant high-tech hub, complete with wide bike lanes for Dutch-style commuting. Billboards along Danbury Road try to attract new <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> employees: ‘Be a part of the company that is part of everything’. The woods of New England have plenty of space to accommodate this growth – or at least, the local politicians are happy to offer it. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> covers two percent of the municipal budget through paying property taxes, and more growth means more funds for Wilton’s public services. We give you space to manufacture chip machines, you give us money for playgrounds and sports fields. For Wilton, it is not a bad deal.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">If Veldhoven reaches its limit, the company would be able to assemble some of the standard machines abroad. Although this would bring them closer to the chip factories, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is trying to avoid this. The network of suppliers is not easily relocated, and the latest generation of scanners always needs to be produced in close proximity to the development department. That is the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> way – short lines speed up learning, making it easier to identify and fix mistakes, which leads to faster progress.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> previously considered relocating part of its production far from Veldhoven. In 1997, there were serious plans to start an extra factory in Taiwan in collaboration with a joint-venture partner. <span class="fft-kk">TSMC</span> was becoming a force of nature, and Veldhoven wanted to keep up. Their plan looked all set to go ahead: a location in Hsinchu was chosen, the engineers were selected and ready to move. But then the Asian financial crisis struck, and the plan was put on ice.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s commitment to the maintenance of the oldest machines is also a frequent subject of discussion. The <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 5500 generation, the machines developed by Martin van den Brink decades ago, are simply not breaking down. As of 2023, almost two thousand of these machines are still running worldwide, and chips made with this ‘mature’ technology are in high demand. One <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> division, affectionately called ‘the thrift shop’, refurbishes these machines at locations nearby Eindhoven airport and in Linkou, Taiwan. But with their unparalleled durability showing no signs of slowing, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> faces the question: should they continue this maintenance indefinitely?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Although these machines may seem indestructible, they still require replacement parts. But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s suppliers have their hands full with orders for the newer scanners and charge high rates for manufacturing such outdated parts.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This is why, around 2018, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> starts toying with the idea of licensing these machines to the Chinese competitor <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span>. If they take over the production of those machines and their parts, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> can focus its resources on new, more complex technology. The deal will also limit <span class="fft-kk">SMEE</span> to less advanced niche markets <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has no interest in. But it never happens. Martin van den Brink cuts off the idea – he wants to maintain control of the ‘installed base’, the name for the more than five thousand <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> systems in operation all over the globe. The thrift shop is needed to keep the competition at bay.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This decision ages well. A couple of years later, having to explain a close collaboration with a Chinese competitor to Washington and The Hague would be the last thing <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needed.</p>
