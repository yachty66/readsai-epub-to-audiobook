			<p class="ff-platmetwit">Sometimes history gets in the way.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">PAS</span> 5500 was a hit, but deliveries were slow. Zeiss was failing to keep up with the demand for lenses, creating a bottleneck in Oberkochen and leaving a growing number of machines stranded in Veldhoven awaiting their optical systems. However, this time the fault didn’t lie with the arduous production process, but the historical upheaval in Germany. Following the fall of the Iron Curtain, Zeiss reunited with its sister plant in the now former East German city of Jena and sunk into debt. With money cautiously starting to trickle into Veldhoven, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was just about able to scrape together a loan to rescue its top supplier. With the blockage resolved, the machines started to move out and the money started to flow in. In 1993, the company made a profit for the first time, and in 1994 more than a hundred lithography machines were sold. Two years later, this figure would double.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Meanwhile, another major player was starting to eye up <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s machines. The South Korean manufacturer Samsung had become interested in using <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s devices for producing memory chips. Standards had slipped with their current Japanese supplier Nikon, who had been delivering devices with faulty lenses and refusing to follow up on the Koreans’ complaints. This deeply angered Samsung, and created just the opportunity <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was looking for. However, convincing the Koreans to change supplier was another story. Aware they held the upper hand, Samsung plied <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> with requests for highly specialized devices in line with exhaustive lists of standards. Yet <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> could only supply its factory-issued machines. There was little capacity for customization, let alone to the degree Samsung were asking.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Tempers ran high during discussions in Seoul. The Korean company was marked by an uncompromising ruthlessness – given the exceptionally tight margins of the memory chip game, everything was about efficiency. Best of luck to anyone responsible for a delay, as might happen if a lithography machine jammed. The ensuing meetings were more like interrogations. Passports were taken upon landing in South Korea, after which the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers were whisked away for ‘negotiations’. In between the yelling, everything from chalk markers, plates, ashtrays and coffee cups flew through the air. Anything within reach was permissible.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Nevertheless, in 1995 an agreement was reached, much to the delight of Veldhoven and anyone who had to frequent these meetings. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> now had to expand to cope with the sudden increase in demand, but there was no building space around the main property. However, Chris van Kasteren, a former milkman with remarkable financial foresight, had a solution. The A67 highway south of Veldhoven was lined with grasslands owned by local farmers. Using his connections in the community, Van Kasteren managed to procure large swathes of these meadows. With the land he made available, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had enough room to expand – for the time being.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Architect Rob van Aken was tasked with keeping the designs mostly functional. The most important requirement was for the buildings to be separable so they could be sold off should <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> almost inevitably fall into trouble. One thing is for sure: no one else would ever be able to make full use of the constructional extravaganza in Veldhoven; thick vibration-dampening floors, suspended foundations and state-of-the-art clean rooms – all without a speck of dust.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">By this point, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had outgrown the graceful pyramid that once enveloped it. The number of engineers and system architects was rapidly increasing, and more office space was needed around the cleanrooms to house the now bulging development departments. These were the driving force of the company, its beating heart with only one goal: to develop new technology faster than the Japanese competition, and with it, to poach the big players from their grasp. And step by step, their plan was beginning to work. Their strategy was focused on ‘adding value’ for the chipmakers, offering tools that could expose as many wafers per hour with as few defects as possible. Lithography technology is essentially a printing press, and the standards that make for a desirable machine are no different. Only rather than books, papers or dollar bills, these machines print semiconductors. And with these, you can make billions of dollars.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Chief executive Willem Maris had a fondness for self-deprecation. He was frequently seen roaming from meeting to meeting, exclaiming what a sight it would be if real management got hold of the company. Business operations at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> hardly exemplified the efficiency they promised of their machines, but so long as they kept the money flowing in no one really cared. Maris, who transferred from the Philips factory, was himself a former top tennis player. As an 18-year-old mechanical engineering student he became the Dutch singles champion, much to his and everyone’s surprise. But, as Maris told newspaper <span class="fft-cursief">De Telegraaf</span> in 1958, he didn’t see a sporting career on the horizon. Now that he was champion he would always be expected to win, something that ‘tends to suck all the joy out of playing.’ If there’s no fun in doing it, forget about it.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In Maris, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had found an accessible leader. He tucked his office in an inconspicuous corner of the building, preferring to be nestled amongst the rest of his workers rather than isolated on the highest floor. From here, he would often wander through the halls of the company, always keen for a chat. With his neatly slicked-back hair and approachable demeanor, Maris struck the figure of a natural salesman. He was also not one for confrontations, preferring to let people have their say before calmly presenting his thoughts and leaning on his fellow board members to cast the opinion in more difficult situations.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It was an approach that suited <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s horizontal structure. Maris fostered a feeling of togetherness, even among suppliers who were being asked to take risks and grow in line with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s expansion. For the partnership with Zeiss, an essential supplier, he came up with the slogan <span class="fft-cursief">Two companies, one business</span>. For all the ups and downs and contractions in the market, he made sure there was never any doubt about their position: there was a common goal, and so the best way to reach it was by working together.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Maris was also the one who managed to retain Martin van den Brink when he was on the cusp of jumping ship. The design of the recent 5500 model had eaten up too much of the budget, and Martin was not granted permission to develop a new machine. The blueprints began to gather dust in a bottom drawer. Frustrated, he considered leaving for Varian, an American supplier in the industry who offered him a position as chief technology officer. Without the freedom and resources to keep innovating, he saw no future for himself and <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. ‘And so I thought: time to move on.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As he was finishing packing his bags for Silicon Valley, he decided to visit his former colleague Frits van Hout. Despite having left for a leadership position at a Swiss company in the crisis of 1992, Van Hout encouraged Martin to rethink his decision: would he really feel at home in an American organization, let alone at a company where he would need to prove himself all over again?</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">News of Van den Brink’s impending departure reverberated throughout the chip industry. The word travelled to Maris via <span class="fft-kk">AMD</span>, who asked the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> if he was aware that his most important technician wanted to leave. The startled Maris took heed of the warning and promptly gave in to Van den Brink’s demands. The latter found himself at the helm of the research and development department in Veldhoven, and, at his insistence, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> began building ‘scanners’. The machines were quickly named the ‘Step &amp; Scan’, a variant of a technology developed by the American competitor PerkinElmer. The scanner operates with a beam of light, similar to a photocopier, which glides across the mask while the wafer moves in the opposite direction, resulting in an increased sharpness of the lines exposed on the chip. Imagine an Olympic runner that, with a pen in one hand and paper in the other, could start sprinting and still manage to produce a highly precise drawing. This gives you an idea of the kind of tightly orchestrated high-tech dance these machines are designed to perform. The 5500 also received a new light source, utilizing for the first time deep ultraviolet light, or <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> for short. Wittekoek and Van den Brink had to persuade Zeiss to adapt their lens design, and went as far as providing the specifications for doing so. This rubbed the Germans the wrong way: these belligerent Dutch know-it-alls thought they were better than their own experts.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">With <span class="fft-kk">DUV</span> and the scanner now under their belt, the team from Veldhoven finally had the tools to give Canon and Nikon a run for their money. The American competitors had already fallen behind, but more capital was still needed to make the leap to first place. Henk Bodt, advising from Philips, deemed going public would be <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s best bet. External financiers had so far proven difficult to bring in; according to Bodt, ‘they were only interested in your business if you were nearly belly-up.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 1995 <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> entered the American stock market <span class="fft-kk">NASDAQ</span> along with the <span class="fft-kk">AEX</span> in Amsterdam. To ensure they retained their pool of talent, a group of forty workers deemed the most valuable were offered share packages, but only on the condition that they couldn’t sell their stake until four years after the company was listed. Thirty technicians and ten managers made the cut. Yet the company’s works council was deeply outraged when it turned out that it was mostly high-ranking managers that were receiving the shares. The Council felt <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s success should benefit everyone, not enrich a select group. As a result, those who didn’t receive the package were instead offered an alternative stock option plan.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The timing was unfortunate for Frits van Hout, who had been long considering a return to Veldhoven. He entered into talks with the company in 1995 but found himself just too late to reap the benefits of this deal. It wasn’t until 2001 that, at Martin’s request, he would take the leap and go back to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. As he put it, ‘In my heart, I never left.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The <span class="fft-kk">IPO</span> took place in March of that year to great success but muted celebrations. The champagne corks would only fly a few years later when the stocks freed up and Veldhoven suddenly found itself home to forty new millionaires. While much of the newfound wealth found its way to beautiful homes and new cars for the whole family, none of the spending was outrageous. At <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, it is considered bad manners to flaunt your wealth. It can only distract from what really matters.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">If you invested one dollar in <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> in 1995 and held onto it until 2024, you would be looking at a share worth more than six hundred times that (including dividends). The success on the market spelled a variety of fortunes for those involved. Philips reduced its stake in <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> after 1995 to 23 percent, and from 2001 would start to decrease that minority interest further. Richard George, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s project leader from the very beginning, sold his shares as quickly as possible. Too quickly, as he admitted with a laugh: ‘If I had kept hold of them, I would have been close to 100 million better off. Can you imagine!’ There was no bitterness, but only pride that his work contributed to the financial success of the company.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Some missed the golden ticket altogether. Joop van Kessel, the chief operating officer who set up the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> organization in 1984, had perhaps the most cause for remorse. He deliberately declined the option plan, later calculating with his wife that he missed out on around 10 million euros. ‘Quite a lot of money,’ as he acknowledges now. But at that moment he couldn’t stand the thought of taking a up a new role in Korea, where <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> still had to accommodate the extremely demanding memory chip manufacturers and provide them with flawless machines. ‘That was a job for someone in their forties, not someone in their sixties.’ A hefty price, but one he never regretted paying.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">All this time, a young accountant from Deloitte had been assisting <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> with the preparation of their <span class="fft-kk">IPO</span>. His name was Peter Wennink, and years later he would find himself at the helm of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, shaking hands with President Joe Biden.</p>
