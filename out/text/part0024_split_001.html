			<p class="ff-platmetwit">The change in <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was evident from miles away. A new head office was rising in Veldhoven, a dark black and green tower stretching 83 meters into the sky. Although known as Building 8, as per their nomenclature, a near-death experience for the company during its construction would lead some to refer to it as the Gravestone.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In 2001, while <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was preoccupied fighting its way through a year of turmoil, Nikon was plotting a surprise attack. The Japanese manufacturer had watched their market share dwindle and stood by as Japanese chipmakers like Seiko, Epson and Sony made the move on <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s equipment. Fellow nationals opting for foreign technology was a disgrace few would bear lightly. It was time for revenge.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">One December morning, Doug Dunn arrived to find a series of complaints on his desk. The Japanese competitor had accused <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> of infringing on thirteen patents, carefully preparing the charges for well over a year to the complete ignorance of Veldhoven. Overwhelmed, Dunn realized <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had been caught with its guard down, and the prospects were not good. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> had managed to patent some of its own technology, but as a young company this paled in comparison to the far more extensive portfolio of Nikon, which had been actively producing lenses and microscopes since 1917. And in conflicts over intellectual property, the party with the greatest number of patents almost always wins. Predicting the outcome is often nothing more than holding a ruler next to the stack of papers: the highest wins.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Nikon was merciless, filing the accusations with the <span class="fft-kk">ITC</span> in Washington and a court in California in an attempt to hit <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> where it hurt the most: the American market. If the <span class="fft-kk">ITC</span> recognized even one patent violation, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would no longer be permitted to supply chip machines to American manufacturers. After all they had sacrificed to break into the market, this would be a fatal blow to the Dutch company.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘They want to destroy you.’ As Doug Dunn heard the words from his lawyers, his heart skipped a beat. Normally, the etiquette was to have a prior consultation between the companies on issues with patents before deciding whether or not to involve the courts. But Nikon had no interest in negotiating or settling. Dunn could already picture the headlines; the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> busy erecting his prized new headquarters, forced to close the lot before he could even step foot on it. An 83-meter monument to the failure of <span class="fft-kk">ASML </span>– a gravestone.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> did the only thing you can do in a patent war – strike back. It sued Nikon, and busied itself assembling a group of independent experts to explain the complex technical details to the <span class="fft-kk">ITC</span> staff. After all, lithography technology was a complicated matter, and they needed to gain as much favor in Washington as possible. Intel and Micron also lent support behind the scenes in an attempt to stave off their own production issues should their supplier succumb to a patent battle.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Dunn tried to force a solution, inviting himself to Japan for a meeting with Nikon’s <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> Shoichiro Yoshida. In his bag he carried a thirty-page weapon faxed to him by his lawyers before embarking on his flight to Tokyo: a copy of the preliminary conclusion of the <span class="fft-kk">ITC</span>, ruling in favor of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Now holding all the cards, he brought along his own interpreter to make sure the conversation kept moving and the Japanese couldn’t seek respite behind any pretense of misunderstanding.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘You’re not going to win this,’ Dunn told Shoichiro Yoshida, but the <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> wouldn’t hear it. His heels were firmly dug in. Dunn responded by laying the documents with the preliminary conclusion on the table, the sight of which caused Yoshida to become enraged with his lawyers. He turned back to Dunn – he needed time to think. The <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> delegation was invited out to dinner that evening; sushi, sake and small talk were on the menu. A meal out was not the time to talk patents. Afterwards the offer from <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> to settle came through to the tune of 100 million dollars. A hefty amount, but for Dunn a price well worth the next five or ten years of conflict it would avoid. But the Japanese refused. They wanted to see the Brabanders on their knees.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Yoshida’s fixation on revenge failed to pay off. When the <span class="fft-kk">ITC</span> brought forward its final ruling a few months later, it turned out that one of Nikon’s patents was itself invalid. A worker had taken it from their previous employer and resubmitted the exact same invention, rendering it null and void. The other claims of patent violations fared no better: none were recognized by the <span class="fft-kk">ITC</span>. It was a resounding victory for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, and an enormous relief for Dunn.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Brit was in the middle of a visit to Zeiss in Oberkochen when the call from his lawyers came through. ‘Should I kill myself or should I cheer?’ was all he could ask as he stepped out the room. Thankfully, cheering it was: the judge had ruled in favor of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> on all counts. Dunn couldn’t believe it: he had to ask several times for the lawyer to repeat the news. The lawsuit in California concluded with a mediation round that saw <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> settle for 87 million dollars, less than they had originally offered. They had quelled their Japanese competitor, at least for the moment.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The Nikon case was a rude awakening for the teams in Veldhoven. The company had paid far too little attention to its intellectual property in its early years, focusing almost entirely on innovation and not considering the need to record and secure their inventions. In the world of modern technology, this was pure lack of experience. Although Dunn would never deny this, he remained sympathetic to why this blind spot came about: ‘<span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> was still a young enterprise. Everything needed to be done at once. We had the smartest people that wanted to make the best machines in the world, and brought together the best ideas to do so. To then also have to record and write these ideas down in excruciating detail is annoying. How much time do people enjoy spending on their tax returns?’ He shrugged. ‘It’s boring! We all know the feeling.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Boring it may be, but protecting the knowledge you produce in this industry is an absolute necessity. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> started in 1984 with no more than a handful of patents and licenses from Philips, which had prioritized protecting their precious CD player instead of filing patents for lithography machines. In the late ’90s, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> created its own department to manage intellectual property. Even then, new patent applications would take years to be approved. But <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> recognized the need to step up their game after Nikon’s surprise attack, introducing a fellowship program that offered a better career path and salary for engineers that registered their ideas. ‘Otherwise it’s only the gray-haired managers getting to drive the luxury cars,’ says Dunn, himself a gray-haired manager.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Three types of fellow can be found at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>: fellows, senior fellows and corporate fellows. Workers are nominated for this based, among other things, on their patents. It is a closed selection process, however, the results of which Martin van den Brink and the head of the research department Jos Benschop announce at the company’s annual technology day.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The best inventors (some of which have more than two hundred patents to their name) are commemorated by having their faces engraved on silicon wafers and hung on a series of large wooden beams, like a Mount Rushmore of the chip industry. It was Van den Brink’s dream to assemble such a wall of famous inventors, just like the names of the acclaimed physicists he once saw adorning the reception hall of Bell Labs in New Jersey, the home of the transistor. The only prize missing from the Veldhoven collection remains a Nobel laureate.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As of 2023, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has registered more than 16,000 patents. A number of these have been developed in collaboration with suppliers that over time have needed to deliver increasingly complex parts to <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Zeiss is by far the most significant of these co-inventors. Former <span class="fft-kk">CEO</span> Hermann Gerlinger referred to this alliance as ‘the ultimate merging of machine and optics, in which <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> tells all their secrets to us, and we in turn share everything with them.’ Coming from the historical German craftsman, it sounds almost romantic.</p>
