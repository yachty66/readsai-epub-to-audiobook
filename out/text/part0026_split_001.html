			<p class="ff-platmetwit">That’s when the shit hits the fan, as Frits van Hout puts it. Or in more polite terms: ‘When Zeiss say they’re ready with the lens, that’s when our problems truly begin.’ As soon as the optical system is completed, that’s when <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> needs to integrate it with the rest of the machine. You can design the perfect lithography machine on paper, but in practice the end result will always deviate from this. With the best will in the world, the only thing you can know for sure is that any plan will fall short.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Martin van den Brink has his own one-liner for this: ‘It’s not about preventing errors, but how well you manage them.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s machines are far too complex for one person to understand in their entirety. The first wafer steppers at Philips required a team of ten to be assembled, and by the time Van den Brink and Van Hout started in 1984, already more than a hundred technicians were working on the devices. Managing this was a science in itself, and so the system design was divided into sections and different teams were allocated to work on these tasks in parallel. The collaboration between all the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> engineers itself became an inscrutable machine. But just like a beehive, what appears to be total chaos is actually the bustling activity of everyone knowing and executing their own role, almost perfectly.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">When a new chip factory requires an investment of billions of dollars before any chips are even close to being printed, everything revolves around value for money. The rule of thumb is that around 30 percent of that capital investment is needed for the lithography machine, the essential tool for transforming cheap and plentiful silicon into valuable chips. The billions will only flow back in if that device delivers the right number of wafers per hour with enough error-free chips. The first chip manufacturer to master this with the latest technology will pay off the expensive machine in no time, a game <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> played like no other.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">It’s all about large volume and small details, so in order to deliver the right equipment for a client’s needs <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> would get deeply familiarized with its customers. Martin van den Brink always wants to know from the bosses of the chip factories precisely what products they have in mind, from which he can devise the technology to make this happen. Whatever he comes up with becomes the driving force of <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s roadmap, shaping the marching orders for the whole company.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The first task in designing a new machine is for the system architects, who in consultation with the chip manufacturers determine what requirements the scanner must fulfill and what that might cost. For instance, if a chip manufacturer wants a machine that produces 290 rather than 270 wafers per hour, the architect may recommend using a more powerful laser, installing faster motors for the wafer or choosing a lens that can be swapped out at a later date.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The job then falls to the engineers in the Development and Engineering department to actually carry out these designs. This department is the nerve center of the whole company. Thousands of engineers specializing in hardware and software work together in <span class="fft-kk">D&amp;E</span> to pick the best technologies to bring these ideas to life.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A lithography machine depends on three properties: the fineness of the mesh that constitutes the integrated circuit, the precision with which the layers in a chip are laid on top of one another, and the movement speed of the wafers (in other words, how much they can feed the machine). How these all work together needs to be carefully negotiated by all parties. It is an ongoing discussion, even within <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The art lies in finding a good balance between time, specification and costs, otherwise known by Frits van Hout as ‘The Holy Trinity’. If the technical requirements are too demanding, you run the risk of building a machine no one can afford, or implementing a production process so complex that you fail to build a machine on time at all. The research departments naturally tend to choose the technology that offers the very best resolutions, and so can create the finest lines. But an improvement here comes at the cost of time: the finer you go, the slower everything has to run to maintain accuracy. Then you have to answer to the chip factories, ever fixated on increasing the speed of production. ‘“Keep on stamping! We’ll never get the smallest resolution so just stamp wafers!” is all we then hear from them,’ according to Van Hout.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The scanners don’t have to be perfect – there’s always room for improvement, as regularly happens with rolling upgrades for components and new machines. They just need to be good enough to get the job done.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Designing a machine at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> is not approached as if it were a perfectly predictable static entity that can be captured by a good blueprint. Rather, the whole process is regarded as cultivating a living organism, continuously adapting to technical setbacks and attuning what you’re creating to the everchanging circumstances it finds itself in. This is not a case of choosing one of many paths up the mountain; this is the only way it can be done. On a microscopic level, no part is identical, no motor runs exactly as fast as the other. Materials vibrate: gases are emitted and parts expand when heated. Every swirling dust particle counts and every single nanometer of difference in a hole or screw has consequences. But as the creator of the whole system, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> has the know-how to compensate for an unexpected turn of events in one corner of the machine by adjusting what would seem to be a completely separate part elsewhere.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The architect is also responsible for the ‘error budget’, which represents the acceptable margins of error for all the different components. These margins are divided like a pie of which each team gets a piece. Your allotted slice is how much you can deviate, no more. The tighter the deadline, the tighter the margins: bars in these cases are set extra high for all components in order to leave more slices of the pie to be freely allocated afterwards, wherever needed. It is the art of ‘overspecifying’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In the meantime, the most important design choices are studied and verified separately to make sure engineers don’t take too much risk, or take a completely wrong turn. This is all done in parallel, for the fastest results and the lowest cycle time – the clock is always ticking at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. The goal: to find as many errors as possible and iron them out before the machine is sent on its way. If you can avoid having to build each part to do this, all the better. With more experience and subsequently more accurate theoretical models, the teams at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> have learned to read and predict almost intuitively what will happen in a machine when you put all the pieces in place.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As the person who oversees the entire life cycle of a new machine, from the drawing table to the factory, the project manager arguably carries the greatest responsibility. The cycle is broken down into fourteen decisive moments, such as the first prototype or the first delivery to the manufacturer, and the responsibilities are further divided according to areas of expertise. Different project leaders busy themselves with the mechatronics, or the wafer-table on which the silicon disc lies or the mask-table that holds the chip pattern, while a different team of experts concern themselves with the millions of lines of code that direct the machine, constantly correcting and bringing all the different moving parts in line.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">This makes the product development manager (or PDM’er) the executive of a series of projects, landing them the tricky task of balancing numerous budgets while fostering cooperation between groups. This is a tough responsibility. ‘From the very start at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>, if the word ‘project’ was involved, then it needed to happen.’ This, according to Frits van Hout, is the ultimate mark of importance in <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. Departments were king at companies like Philips, but in Veldhoven this is flipped on its head. ‘Projects involving new machines are our lifeblood. Anyone not in line with this would be quickly put in their place.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">A manager at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> confirms this. ‘The program wields the power in this company,’ emphasizing the word ‘program’ like it was the name of some deity with a capital ‘P’.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">As the machines grow in complexity, so too does the project structure. More target dates, milestones, more people, more meetings, more abbreviations. Technicians jump from one project to the other, chasing problems as they come up. Moments to bask in successes are few and far between.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘What’s it like developing machines for <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>? Might as well be developing crack, it’s that addictive,’ says Markus Matthes, former head of D&amp;E. ‘We work so fast that we don’t even have the specs ready when we start to design. Now that’s a thrill.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Matthes previously worked in the automotive industry, a risk-averse culture that starkly contrasts with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>. ‘I was done with all the incessant rules and cost restrictions of the car world. This place is every engineer’s dream.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Dream it may be, but Martin van den Brink has a knack for snapping heads back to reality. His ‘reviews’, the discussions on the progress of the technology, largely involve constant reiterations of the importance of avoiding ‘flamboyant’ overengineering. As he points out: ‘Our machines are equipped with enough valves and pipes. There’s no need for them to be unnecessarily complex or costly.’ He often asks, ‘Do you do this at home too? Beneath every toilet there’s a pipe made of cheap plastic. So why do we insist on having one made of stainless steel?’ Nothing is safe from scrutiny, and every choice needs to be justifiable.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Gregor van Baars, associated with the Dutch research organization <span class="fft-kk">TNO</span>, worked in close partnership with <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> on the development of their new machines. ‘They dissect the machine into manageable pieces, assigning each person a specific section of the puzzle,’ he explains. ‘Then it’s just a matter of extensive drawing and calculating, with constant discussion and coordination. It’s the pinnacle of hardcore engineering.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The most challenging aspect is maintaining harmony among all the scientific disciplines involved: ‘Imagine someone devises a smart new motor. Someone from the thermal group will then raise concerns about the increase in the machine’s temperature due to the more powerful heat source. Effective communication and a solid grasp of the other fields involved are the only way to make this work.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">According to Van Baars, <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> excels in identifying and resolving hiccups in the machines. ‘An entire army of engineers is immersed in a kind of crime scene investigation to find the source of the errors, and figure out exactly how to correct or compensate for them. After a while it gets difficult to distinguish what were meant to be solutions within this web and make sure these don’t interfere or even counteract with each other. That’s why they have an astronomical number of engineers. It’s insane.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">But as Frits van Hout explains, it’s not a case of one-size-fits-all when it comes to engineers. ‘A mechanical engineer can create and design structures, whereas an electronic engineer designs circuits. And physicists may “understand” everything, but ask them to actually do something and see how useful they are.’ Spoken as a true physicist.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The technicians at <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span> are expected to continually challenge one another, to never blindly accept what someone has said simply on the basis that they hold a higher position in the company. Egos need to be checked at the door, and for good reason. As Frits van Hout points out, this flatness gives a degree of security and protection essential to the smooth running of such an intense operation. ‘Even as the boss, if you’re completely in the wrong with a decision, you can at least be sure someone will say something about it.’</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">‘When it comes to allocating available budget and workers, the <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’ers compete against one another. It’s a company that works in an extremely informal manner,’ wrote Theo Verkaart, a researcher from TU Eindhoven who analyzed the production process at Veldhoven in 2013. ‘There’s no uniform approach, and project leaders tend to hide what they actually have in reserve, only to then demand higher requirements during the budget negotiations.’ Screaming bloody murder is the only way to get things done in this company: if you’re not making yourself heard, good luck getting a share of the pie you need.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat"><span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s customers are just as unpredictable: chip manufacturers are prone to abruptly altering demands, changing orders or suddenly asking for extra options and new features. ‘You turn away for a second, and suddenly they all want a new plaything for their machine,’ as Van den Brink puts it. He tends to choose the simplest words for the most complex parts.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">In between juggling these requests for alterations, it falls to the program managers to keep everyone on track to hit the deadlines. They not only ensure the prototypes are ready, but also oversee the procurement of parts and spares.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">Another vital consideration is whether the factories actually have the capacity necessary for the assembly of the machines. Despite the depth of ingenuity and engineering prowess involved in this process, the most obvious problems can be the easiest to overlook: will the machine fit in the flight container and through the door of the factory? Some chip-factories had to demolish an outer wall when <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s newest machine turned out slightly larger than expected.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The lifecycle of a new lithography machine doesn’t end upon delivery (otherwise called the <span class="fft-kk">NPI</span>, or New Product Introduction). The approach here between the lithography manufacturers differs wildly. <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s machines still require extensive remedial work, while <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s competitors in Japan always aim to deliver machines the same way they deliver their cameras; finely tuned, and ready for immediate use. You just need to plug it in.</p>
			<p class="ff-plat">The latter may seem the obvious choice, but <span class="fft-kk">ASML</span>’s ‘perfect enough’ approach has its advantages. With this method, the chip manufacturer can begin their own testing much quicker, allowing them to fine-tune the device to the particularities of their environment and get it on its way to fulfilling its purpose: exposing wafers all day, every day. And that’s a different ball game.</p>
